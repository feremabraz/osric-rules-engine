 * Character Entity Tests - OSRIC Compliance

 * Tests the Character entity from entities/Character.ts:
 * - Enhanced entity behavior and command integration
 * - OSRIC data preservation
 * - Entity-specific functionality
 *
 * NOTE: These are placeholder tests for the restructured test architecture.
 * Real tests will be implemented when Character entity is actively used in Phase 2+.
