### Table of Contents

## Chapter 5: Monsters

The following material is by no means an exhaustive list of creatures that may be found in OSRIC-compatible games. It is intended only as a brief introduction to the vast range of creatures available under the system. Of course, several books published in the 1970s and 80s contain other suitable creatures. The reader's attention is also respectfully drawn to “Monsters of Myth,” published by the First Edition Society and printed by Lulu ([http://www.lulu.com](http://stores.lulu.com/firsteditionsociety "http://stores.lulu.com/firsteditionsociety")), for a further 150 or so creatures that have not previously appeared in an OSRIC-compatible hardcover book.

## Monster Statistics

Each of the monsters in this book has a number of listed characteristics. The meaning of each characteristic is as follows:

Frequency: The monster's relative rarity in a typical game world can fall into five categories. A unique monster is the only one in existence. Very rare monsters are seldom en- countered, and when seen it is a matter of great interest to naturalists and sages. A rare monster is one usually known to the average peasant, but only in rumour and folklore. Uncommon creatures are known to the common folk but are infrequently seen. Common creatures are familiar, and when they are seen, it may be cause for alarm but not surprise.

**No. Encountered:** This is only a guideline for the GM and should vary according to the circumstances. It is quite possible to encounter a lone orc, for example.

**Size:** Three categories are possible here, being Small (i.e. of less weight or mass than a normal human), Medium or Man-sized (i.e. weighing roughly the same as a human), and Large (generally bigger than a human).

**Move:** Movement is expressed in feet per turn or round (see [Chapter 3](https://osricwiki.presgas.name/doku.php?id=osric:chapter3#movement "osric:chapter3")). Flying creatures' aerial agility level (see [Chapter 3](https://osricwiki.presgas.name/doku.php?id=osric:chapter3#aerial_agility "osric:chapter3")) is indicated thus: “AA:level” in parentheses.

**Armour Class:** Armour class (AC) is as described in [Chapter 1](https://osricwiki.presgas.name/doku.php?id=osric:chapter1#armour "osric:chapter1"). The AC value for a creature does not necessarily mean it is wearing the equivalent armour type, so an AC 5 creature may not necessarily be wearing chain mail, even if it is generally similar to a human.

**Hit Dice:** The number of hit points for a creature is determined by rolling dice. Usually hit dice (HD) are d8s unless otherwise specified. Some creatures have hit points in the format “X+Y” or “X-Y”, in which case “X” refers to the number of dice rolled and “Y” refers to a numerical adjustment applied to the total (note in the case of “X-Y” the resulting hit points cannot be less than 1). Thus, a creature with HD 4+1 has 4d8+1 hp, for a total numerical range of 5-33.

**Attacks:** This entry refers to the number of attacks per round the creature normally possesses in melee. This number may be modified by certain spells such as _haste_ or _slow_ and does not include any special attack forms such as a breath weapon. Note the distinction between “attacks” and “attack routines” as described in Chapter 3—many creatures have several attacks, but very few have several separate attack routines. In the rare cases where one does, this is described in the creature text.

**Damage:** This entry indicates the number and type of dice to be rolled for damage if the creature's physical attacks hit. If the value provided is “by weapon” the GM should decide what weapon the monster is using and refer to [Chapter 1](https://osricwiki.presgas.name/doku.php?id=osric:chapter1#equipment "osric:chapter1"). In some cases the damage inflicted may include a magical element, poison, or some other effect requiring a saving throw or other special ruling, but in this case the attack form will be listed as a “special attack” and detailed in the creature text.

**Special Attacks:** This entry is a short note regarding any unusual attack forms the creature might possess. Unless the special attack are so simple as to be self-evident, these unusual attacks are fully explained in the creature text.

**Special Defences:** This entry, like the entry for special attacks, is really just a signal to the GM that the monster has unusual or magical protections described in the creature text.

**Magic Resistance:** This is the chance, expressed as a percentage, that the creature will be unaffected by any magic specifically targeted at it. Even if the chance fails, the creature may still receive a saving throw if the spell or magical attack form normally calls for one. This percentage is predicated on a caster of 11th level of experience, and should be varied by 5% downwards or upwards per experience level of the caster above or below 11th respectively.

**Lair Probability:** This is the chance that the creature will be encountered in its lair. Creatures not met in their lair are termed “wandering”. Generally, most creatures will keep some or most of their treasure in their lair, so if the monster is wandering, the players will normally need to find the lair to obtain its full treasure.

**Intelligence:** This indicates the intelligence of the creature relative to the average human. Possible values include “Non-”, “Animal”, “Semi-”, “Low”, “Average”, “Very”, “High”, “Exceptional”, “Genius” or occasionally even higher. A non-intelligent creature has an effective intelligence of 0 and a genius has an effective intelligence of 18.

**Alignment:** See the description of alignment in [Chapter 1](https://osricwiki.presgas.name/doku.php?id=osric:chapter1#alignment "osric:chapter1"). The alignment shown for any given type of monster may not represent the alignment of an individual creature of that type. In the case of less intelligent monsters, there is usually little variation, but a few of the more intelligent ones might deviate from the prevailing alignment by a small amount. Thus it is possible to have a Neutral Evil goblin, or even a tribe of Neutral Evil goblins—but good aligned ones would be rare in the extreme.

This does not impinge on the GM's right to make sweeping adjustments to creature alignments for the purposes of a specific campaign.

**Level/XP Value:** This represents a pre-calculation of the creature's Experience Point (XP) value and level as determined in [Chapter 3](https://osricwiki.presgas.name/doku.php?id=osric:chapter3#experience "osric:chapter3"). Note that the Chapter 3 guidelines are exactly that—guidelines. In some cases the XP value has been adjusted to take account of special factors and could not be reached by the Chapter 3 method. In case of conflict, the values given in Chapter 5 should prevail.

**Treasure:** Treasure values are for the maximum possible number of creatures encountered. If fewer than the maximum number of creatures are met, the GM should give thought to reducing the treasure shown proportionally. A percentage listed in brackets indicates the chance that treasure will appear; otherwise, there will be nothing. “Maps”, where listed, will be maps of parts of the dungeon or wilderness near where the monster lairs—they may, or may not, show where traps and/or treasure may be found.

## Tribal Spell Casters

There are two types of tribal spell casters, shamans (clerics) and witch doctors (cleric/magic users). The following races are examples of creatures that have these spell casters: Batrachians, Bugbears, Cavemen, Ettins, Giants, Gnolls, Goblins, Hobgoblins, Kobolds, Lizard Men, Ogres, Orcs, Troglodytes, and Trolls.

### Shaman

Shamans are tribal clerics of 7th level and less. The level of the shaman is restricted based on the race of the tribe. The number of spells received is based solely on the level of the shaman; there is no bonus for wisdom scores.

**3****rd Level Max.** **5****th Level Max.** **7****th Level Max.** Ettin Bugbear Caveman Ogre Gnoll Giant (only Hill, Stone, Fire, and Frost) Troglodyte Kobold Goblin Troll Orc Hobgoblin Anuran Batrachian Lizard Man

Only the following spells and their reverses (if any) are available to shamans:

**1st Level 2nd Level 3rd Level 4th Level** _cure light wounds augury cure blindness divination detect evil chant cure disease exorcise detect magic detect charm dispel magic neutralize poison light resist fire locate object tongues protection from evil snake charm prayer resist fear speak with animals remove curse_

### Witch Doctor

Witch doctors are cleric/magic users with a maximum of 4th level as a magic user (based on the race of the caster). A tribe will never have both a shaman and a witch doctor; they will have only one or the other, unless they are cavemen.

**2****nd Level Max.** **4** **Level Max.** Bugbear Caveman Gnoll Goblin Kobold Hobgoblin Lizard Man Orc Anuran Batrachian

Only the following spells are available to witch doctors:

**1****st Level** **2****nd Level** _a__ffect normal fires_ _a__udible glamour_ _d__ancing lights_ _d__etect invisibility_ _i__dentify_ _i__nvisibility_ _p__ush_ _l__evitate_ _s__hield_ _m__agic mouth_ _v__entriloquism_ _s__care_

### Optional Rules for Tribal Spell Casters

Hit Dice and Attack Rolls: If a tribal spell caster is of 1st level, it will have the hit points and hit dice of a normal creature of that kind. Each additional level in its highest spell casting class grants +1d6 hp and a bonus of +1 on “to hit” rolls, so an orcish witch doctor who is a 5th/4th level cleric/ magic user will have 1d8+4d6 hp and attack at +4 “to hit” relative to his or her fellows.

**Giants:** In campaigns with a very Norse flavour, certain giants may have illusionist rather than clerical powers. Use the rules for a tribal shaman as described above, but grant the giant phantasmal spells rather than divine ones. In this case, the giant may use any phantasmal spell in his or her spell book; this overrides the restrictions on tribal spell caster magic as described above.

## Men

Normal men (non-adventuring types) will usually have 1d6 hit points. In any encounter with men, there will always be higher level characters as leaders (the number will be given under each entry).

All higher level clerics and fighters will be mounted on medium warhorses. For each level a leader type has, there is a 5% chance of possessing a magic item in each of the categories below. For each “Y” in the table below roll. If the result is undesirable, one re-roll is allowed.

<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Fighter</strong></td><td><strong>Magic user</strong></td><td><strong>Cleric</strong></td><td><strong>Thief</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Armour</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td>Shield</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>Sword</td><td>Y</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>Misc.

Magic</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr></tbody></table>

\*If no weapon (or an edged weapon is rolled), roll again on Wand/Staff/Rod (if not usable by a cleric then there is none present).

**Bandit (Brigand)**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency:</strong></td><td>Common</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. Encountered:</strong></td><td>20d10</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size:</strong></td><td>Man-sized</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Move:</strong></td><td>120-ft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Armour Class:</strong></td><td>Determined by armour worn</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td>1d6 hp</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage:</strong></td><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Attacks:</strong></td><td>Leader types may have spells</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Defences:</strong></td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong></td><td>Standard</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lair Probability:</strong></td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intelligence:</strong></td><td>Mean (average to very)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong></td><td>Neutral (chaotic evil)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level/XP:</strong></td><td>Variable</td></tr></tbody></table>

Bandits are found in almost any locale, for wherever there is a civilisation there will be those who prey upon the weak. There will always be higher level fighters found with large groups of bandits. Consult the chart below to determine the exact number and level.

For every 20 bandits: 1 additional 3rd level fighter For every 30 bandits: 1 additional 4th level fighter For every 40 bandits: 1 additional 5th level fighter For every 50 bandits: 1 additional 6th level fighter

Bandits will always be led by a high level fighter (8th to 10th level), 6 guards (2nd level), and a lieutenant (7th level). These members are in addition to those described above. The level of the commander is determined as follows:

-   Under 100 bandits: 8th level fighter
    
-   100 to 150 bandits: 9th level fighter
    
-   Over 150 bandits: 10th level fighter
    

There is a 25% chance per 50 bandits of a magic user being present with the group. If there is a magic user present he will be 7th to 10th level (determined by 1d4 roll).

There is a 15% chance per 50 bandits of a cleric being present with the group, if a cleric is present he will be 5th or 6th level and he will be accompanied by an assistant of 3rdor 4th level.

**Brigand:** Brigands are a chaotic evil lot; otherwise they conform to the rules for bandits above. However they fight more fiercely in battle, and as a result receive a +1 morale bonus.

_Treasure:_ Individual 2d4 gp; Lair 1d6×1,000 cp (25%), 1d6×1,000 sp (30%), 1d6×1,000 ep (35%), 1d10×1,000 gp (40%), 1d4×100 pp (25%), 4d10 gems (60%), 3d10 jewellery (50%), 3 magic items (30%)

**Berserker**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency:</strong></td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. Encountered:</strong></td><td>10d10</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size:</strong></td><td>Man-sized</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Move:</strong></td><td>12-ft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Armour Class:</strong></td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td>1d6+1 hp</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td><td>1 (or 2)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage:</strong></td><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Attacks:</strong></td><td>Leader types</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Defences:</strong></td><td>Leader types</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong></td><td>Standard</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lair Probability:</strong></td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intelligence:</strong></td><td>Mean (average to very)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong></td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level/XP:</strong></td><td>Variable</td></tr></tbody></table>

Berserkers are roaming bands of fighters. They are always unarmoured, as they see it as a sign of weakness. They fight with a fierce battle-lust, and as a result they may strike twice in a round or make one attack at +2. They never roll for morale checks once engaged in battle.

There will always be higher level fighters found with large groups of berserkers. Consult the chart below to determine the exact number and level.

-   For every 10 berserkers: 1 additional 1st level fighter
    
-   For every 20 berserkers: 1 additional 2nd level fighter
    
-   For every 30 berserkers: 1 additional 3rd level fighter
    
-   For every 40 berserkers: 1 additional 4th level fighter
    
-   For every 50 berserkers: 1 additional 5th level fighter
    

Berserkers will always be led by a war chief of 9th or 10th level and a sub-chief of 6th or 7th level, as follows.

-   If less than 60: 9th level chief & 6th level sub-chief
    
-   If more than 60: 10th level chief & 7th level sub-chief
    

There is a 50% chance per every 10 berserkers, that a cleric will be present. The cleric will be of 7th level and will have 1d4 assistants of 3rd or 4th level.

_Treasure:_ Individual 3d6 sp; Lair 1d8×1,000 cp (50%), 1d6×1,000 sp (25%), 1d4×1,000 ep (25%), 1d3×1,000 pp (25%), 1d8 gems (30%), 1d4 jewellery (20%), 1 magic item (10%).

**Buccaneer (Pirate)**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency:</strong></td><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. Encountered:</strong></td><td>50d6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size:</strong></td><td>Man-sized</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Move:</strong></td><td>120-ft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Armour Class:</strong></td><td>Determined by armour worn</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td>1d6 hp</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage:</strong></td><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Attacks:</strong></td><td>Leader types</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Defences:</strong></td><td>Leader types</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong></td><td>Standard</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lair Probability:</strong></td><td>80% or 100%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intelligence:</strong></td><td>Mean (average to very)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong></td><td>Neutral (chaotic evil)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level/XP:</strong></td><td>Variable</td></tr></tbody></table>

Buccaneers are found on all large bodies of water, their lair is most always the ship they use for raiding. They are always led by high level fighters as follows:

-   For every 50 buccaneers: 1 additional 3rd level fighter
    
-   For every 100 buccaneers: 1 additional 5th level fighter
    

The overall captain will be a fighter of 8th to 10th level as follows:

-   If there are less than 200 buccaneers: 8th level fighter with a lieutenant of 6th level
    
-   If there are 200 buccaneers or more: 10th level fighter with a lieutenant of 7th level.
    

The captain will also have 4 mates (4th level fighters) in addition to his or her lieutenant.

There is a 15% chance of a cleric being present per every 50 buccaneers. The cleric will be between 12th and 15th level (1d4+11).

There is a 10% chance of a magic user being present for every 50 buccaneers; the magic user will be between 6th and 8th level (1d3+5).

**Pirate:** Pirates are chaotic evil, but otherwise conform to buccaneers above.

_Treasure:_ Individual 3d6 sp; Lair 5d6×1,000 gp (60%), 1d8×100 pp (15%), 1d8×10 gems (60%), 5d8 jewellery (50%), 1 map (55%).

**Dervish (Nomad)**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency:</strong></td><td>Rare (Uncommon)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. Encountered:</strong></td><td>30d10</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size:</strong></td><td>Man-sized</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Move:</strong></td><td>120-ft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Armour Class:</strong></td><td>Determined by armour worn</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td>1d6 hp</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage:</strong></td><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Attacks:</strong></td><td>Leader types</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Defences:</strong></td><td>Leader types</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong></td><td>Standard</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lair Probability:</strong></td><td>5% (15%)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intelligence:</strong></td><td>Mean (average to very)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong></td><td>Lawful good (neutral)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level/XP:</strong></td><td>Variable</td></tr></tbody></table>

Dervishes are highly religious desert nomads. They will always be led by higher level fighters and clerics as follows. They are fanatical devotees to their religion. As a result they are at +1 to combat and never need to check morale.

**Fighters**

-   For every 30 dervishes: 1 additional 3rd level fighter
    
-   For every 40 dervishes: 1 additional 4th level fighter
    
-   For every 50 dervishes: 1 additional 5th level fighter
    

**Clerics**

-   If under 125 dervishes: (1) 10th level cleric and 2 assistants (4th & 5th level clerics)
    
-   If under 250 dervishes: (1) 11th level cleric and 2 assistants (6th & 7th level clerics)
    
-   If more than 250: (1) 12th level cleric and 2 assistants (both 8th level clerics)
    

There is a 15% chance per 50 dervishes that a magic user will be present. The magic user will be of 7th or 8th level (if more than 200 dervishes are present) and his two assistants of 3rd or 4th level.

Dervishes are always mounted on light or medium warhorses.

**Nomad:** Nomads are mounted clans that live on steppes, plains or in desert climes. They live by hunting and gathering and are closely tied to their native climate. Due to their closeness with their surroundings, they surprise on 1-4. Nomads will always be led by higher level fighters as follows:

-   If under 150 nomads: (1) 8th level fighter, (1) 6th level fighter, and 12 guards (2nd level fighters)
    
-   Between 150-250 nomads: (1) 9th level fighter, (1) 7th level fighter, and guards (2nd level fighters)
    

Over 250 nomads: (1) 10th level fighter, (1) 8th level fighter, and guards (2nd level fighters)

There is a 15% chance per 50 nomads that a cleric will be present. The cleric will be of 4th to 7th level (determined by 1d4). There is also a 15% chance per 50 nomads that a magic user (of 5th to 8th level, also determined by 1d4) will be present. Irrespective of the above, there will always be (2) 3rd level clerics and (1) 4th level magic user present.

Nomads will always be mounted on either light or medium warhorses.

_Treasure:_ Individual 3d12 cp (2d6 ep); Lair 1d3×1,000 cp (20%), 1d4×1,000 sp (25%), 1d4×1,000 ep(25%), 1d4×1,000 gp (30%), 1d6×100 pp (30%), 1d6×10 gems (55%), jewellery (50%), 3 magic items (50%)

**Pilgrim**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency:</strong></td><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. Encountered:</strong></td><td>10d10</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size:</strong></td><td>Man-sized</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Move:</strong></td><td>120-ft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Armour Class:</strong></td><td>Determined by armour worn</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td>1d6 hp</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage:</strong></td><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Attacks:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Defences:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong></td><td>Standard</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lair Probability:</strong></td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Treasure:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intelligence:</strong></td><td>Mean (very to high)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level/XP:</strong></td><td>Variable</td></tr></tbody></table>

Pilgrims are groups of religious followers making their way to some holy site. They can be encountered almost anywhere. There will always be higher level character types with groups of pilgrims, determined as follows.

**Clerics:** (there will always be clerics with pilgrims, if the group is neutral these clerics will be druids)

1.  1d6 2nd level clerics
    
2.  1d4 4th level clerics
    
3.  1d2 6th level clerics
    
4.  1 8th level cleric with 2 assistants (3rd and 5th level)
    

**Fighters:** There is a 10% chance per every 10 pilgrims that there will be 1d10 fighters present (roll 1d8 to determine the levels of the fighters). If the group is lawful good, some of these fighters may be replaced by paladins. If the group is chaotic good, some of these fighters may be replaced by rangers.

**Thieves:** There is a 10% chance per every 10 pilgrim that there will be 1d6 thieves present (roll 1d6+1 to determine the levels of the thieves). If the group is evil, some of these thieves may be replaced by assassins.

**Magic users:** There is a 5% chance per every 10 pilgrims that there will be a magic user present (level 1d4+5).

Alignment is determined by rolling d% with the likelihood of each alignment as follows:

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>d%</strong></td><td><strong>Alignment</strong></td></tr><tr><td>01-34</td><td>lawful good</td></tr><tr><td>35-55</td><td>chaotic good</td></tr><tr><td>56-66</td><td>neutral</td></tr><tr><td>65-80</td><td>chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><td>81-00</td><td>lawful evil</td></tr></tbody></table>

Most of the time (75%) pilgrims will be travel without mounts. However if they are mounted, all members of the group will be mounted.

_Treasure:_ Treasure for the group will be as follows.

_Pilgrims (ea.):_ 3d12 cp.

_Fighters (ea.):_ 2d6 ep.

_Clerics (ea.):_ 3d12 cp, 3d6 sp, and 2d4 gp.

_Magic users (ea.):_ 2d6 ep, 1d6 pp, and 1d4 gems (50%).

_Thieves (ea.):_ 3d12 cp, 1d6 pp, and 1d4 gems (50%).

There is also a chance (5%) that a holy item will be with the pilgrims. If so, it will be hidden and carefully guarded.

**Merchant**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency:</strong></td><td>Common</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. Encountered:</strong></td><td>50d6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size:</strong></td><td>Man-sized</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Move:</strong></td><td>120-ft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Armour Class:</strong></td><td>Determined by armour worn</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td>1d6 hp</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage:</strong></td><td>By weapon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Attacks:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Defences:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong></td><td>Standard</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lair Probability:</strong></td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Treasure:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intelligence:</strong></td><td>Mean (very to high)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong></td><td>Neutral</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level/XP:</strong></td><td>Variable</td></tr></tbody></table>

Merchant encounters are actually caravans of merchants, drovers, and guards. The caravan will also contain pack animals, carts, and horses. Of the number appearing rolled, only about 10% will actually be merchants. 10% will be drovers and the last 80% will be the guards.

The guards will always be led by higher level fighter of 6th to 11th level (1d6+5), his or her lieutenant (1 level lower than the captain), and 12 guards (2nd level fighters).

There is a 10% chance per 50 persons that a magic user of 6th to 8th level is present (1d3+5). There is a 5% chance per 50 persons that a cleric of 5th to 7th level (1d3+4) is present. There is also a 15% chance per 50 persons that a thief of 8th to 10th level will be present (along with 1d4 lower level thieves of 3rd to 7th level). All of the above leader or special character types are in addition to the number of merchants generated. At least 50% of the mercenary guards will be mounted on light or medium warhorses.

_Treasure:_ The treasure for a caravan will be as follows:

_Individual Merchants:_ 3d12 cp, 3d6 sp, 2d6 ep, 2d4 gp, 1d6 pp, 2d4 gp (40%), 1d6x10 pp (50%), 4d8 gems (55%), 1d12 pieces of jewellery (45%).

_Individual Mercenaries:_ 3d6 sp. Individual Leaders: 2d4 gp.

_Mercenary Pay Box (Hidden in caravan):_ 2,000-4,000 gold (1d3+1), 100-400 pp (1d4), and 4d4 gems).

_Caravan Goods:_ The caravan will be carrying goods and merchandise worth 10,000 to 60,000 gp. This requires either 10 pack animals or 1 cart per 5,000 gp worth of goods.

## Demi-Humans

“Demi-humans” in OSRIC are human-like creatures that are generally kindly-disposed towards humans. They are often of races that can become player characters. As a rule, demi-humans are opposed to humanoids (q.v.) and may also, in some campaign worlds, be opposed to each other. For example, in campaign worlds inspired by the words of J.R.R. Tolkien, dwarfs (there spelled “dwarves”) often hate elves.

Some NPC demi-humans may be clerics. This is not necessarily permitted to player characters of that race; the few clerics in these societies are closely-guarded and watched, and usually may not leave.

**Dwarf**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency:</strong></td><td>Common</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. Encountered:</strong></td><td>40d10</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size:</strong></td><td>Small (4-ft tall)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Move:</strong></td><td>60-ft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Armour Class:</strong></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage:</strong></td><td>1d8 or by weapon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Attacks:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Defences:</strong></td><td>Save at 4 levels higher (see below)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong></td><td>As above</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lair Probability:</strong></td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intelligence:</strong></td><td>Very</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong></td><td>Lawful good</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level/XP:</strong></td><td>2/30+1/hp</td></tr></tbody></table>

Dwarfs are sturdy demi-humans who live in extended clans. They typically make their homes in rocky hills. Dwarfs are led by higher level leader types as follows:

-   For every 40 dwarfs: 2nd to 6th level fighter (1d6, 1 = 2nd level, 2-6 = level)
    
-   If over 160 dwarfs: 1 6th level fighter (chief) & 1 4th level fighter (lieutenant)
    
-   If over 200 dwarfs: 1 fighter/cleric (of 3rd to 6th level as fighter and 4th to 7th level as cleric)
    
-   If over 320 dwarfs: 1 8th level fighter, 1 7th level fighter, 1 6th level fighter/ 7th level cleric
    

If encountered in their lair: 2d6 fighters (2nd to 5th level), 2d4 fighter/clerics (2nd to 4th level), females (50% total of males) and young (25% total of males)

Higher level fighters and fighter/clerics have a 10% chance (per level) of having magic armour or weapons.

Dwarfs are typically armoured in chain mail and carry shields. Axes and hammers are their weapons of choice. Dwarfs receive a +1 on “to hit” rolls vs goblins, orcs, and hobgoblins due to their intense hatred of these races. When in melee with giants, trolls, and ogres, these opponents must fight at -4 due to their size and the skill of dwarfs in fighting such opponents.

Dwarfs are a hardy people, and save vs poison and magic as if they were 4 levels higher than their actual level. Dwarfs have infravision to 60-ft and are excellent miners. They speak goblin, gnome, kobold, and orc in addition to their own tongue.

_Description:_ Dwarfs have a dark brown to deep tan coloured skin tone. They grow long beards and their hair colour tends towards browns and blacks. They favour dark sombre colours for their clothing, with flashes of bright colours. They are short but have stocky builds and are known for their great strength. In some campaign worlds, they may wear kilts.

Dwarf females are bearded.

_Mountain Dwarfs:_ These dwarfs are similar to their cousins, the hill dwarfs (described above), except they have 1d8+1 hit dice and they are slightly taller (4½-ft tall).

_Treasure:_ Individual 2d4×5 gp; lair 10d4×1,000 gp (50%), 1d20×100 pp (50%), 5d4 gems (30%), 1d4×20 gems (50%), 1d10 jewellery (25%), any 4 magic items (15%).

Sometimes elves live in a complex civilisation, other times they are found living in wild bands. While there are several different types of elves, most do share the following traits.

Elves live in a rather loose society where independent clans pledge their support to a central ruler. They will likely place their homes in a secluded thicket or meadow.

When encountered in groups of 20 or more there will likely be a fighter of 2nd level or better. If there are 40 or more then there will probably be a 2nd level fighter / 2nd level magic user or better in the group. If there are 100 or more elves then the leader is likely to be a 4th level fighter / 8th level magic user with 2 additional 4th level fighters / 5th level magic users, and a 4th level fighter / 4th level magic user / 4th level cleric. If the elves are encountered in their homes then there will be an equal number of males to females. Because elves reproduce so slowly, only about 5% of the couples will have children.

Typically elves will wear scale, ring, or chain armour and shield. They will be usually armed with spears, swords, and bows. Higher level fighter / magic users and fighter / magic user / clerics have a 10% chance per level per class to possess some sort of usable magic item.

Elves have the ability to move silently when in natural surroundings, as such they are able to surprise on a roll of 1-4 on a d6. Also elves are able to blend into foliage and become virtually invisible, so long as they do not attack. When using any pulled bow or sword elves receive a +1 to their attack roll.

Also elves have a resistance of 90% to _sleep_ and _charm_ spells. Elves possess infravision with a range of about 60-ft. They can even detect secret doors on a roll of 1 on a d6. If the elf is searching then it is a roll of 1-2 on a d6. On a roll of 1-3 on a d6 and elf can find a concealed door if they are actively searching.

Elves have their own language, and can also speak goblin, orc, hobgoblin, gnoll, halfling, and gnome.

An elf's appearance is rather thin and pale. Although their hair is dark, their eyes are green. Elves like to dress in shades of blue, green, or violet.

The life span of an elf is 1,200 years or more.

_Treasure:_ 1d6 pp per individual in addition to the magic described above.

Gnomes live underground in hills that they have burrowed into, seeking gems and precious metals. They are divided into clans which are rather competitive with each other, but are never outright hostile. They are a distant relative to dwarfs.

For every 40 gnomes encountered there usually is a fighter of 2nd level or higher levels acting as leader. When the groups are of 200 or more there are clerics as well, usually 4th level or higher. If the gnomes are encountered in their burrows, there will be as many males as there are females.

Additionally about 25% of the couples will have young. Most of the time the gnomes will have badgers, or other burrowing animals, that they have trained to act as sentries.

Typically when gnomes are encountered they will be wearing studded leather armour or ring armour and a shield. Gnomes are usually armed with a club and spear, sometimes with a short sword and spear.

When gnomes fight kobolds and goblins they fly into an intense rage and gain an additional +1 to hit. When gnomes battle gnolls, bugbears, ogres, trolls, or giants these creatures receive a -4 to their attack rolls due to the gnomes smaller size and nimbleness.

Due to their natural resilience to both magic and poison, gnomes save against these effects at four levels higher then they actually are. Gnomes have infravision that enables them to see 60-ft in the dark. Gnomes are excellent miners, possessing the abilities to detect whether a pas- sage slopes upward or downward or if a corridor, walls, floors or ceiling is safe or not. They can even estimate depth and direction underground.

Besides their own language, gnomes can also speak kobold, goblin, halfling, dwarfish, and can also speak a language commonly known to all burrowing animals.

Gnomes have wood-brown skin, white hair, and light to deep blue eyes. They like to dress in leather and earthy colours, and wear lots of jewellery.

Gnomes live typically about 600 years.

_Treasure:_ 6d4 gp per individual.

**Halfling**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency:</strong></td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. Encountered:</strong></td><td>30d10</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size:</strong></td><td>Small</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Move:</strong></td><td>90-ft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Armour Class:</strong></td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td>1d6 hp</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage:</strong></td><td>1d6 or by weapon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Attacks:</strong></td><td>+3 “to hit” with bow or sling</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Defences:</strong></td><td>Save at 4 levels higher (see below)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lair Probability:</strong></td><td>70%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intelligence:</strong></td><td>Very</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong></td><td>Lawful good</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level/XP:</strong></td><td>1/5+1/hp</td></tr></tbody></table>

Halflings as a race value hard work and simple living. Their settlements are as likely to contain small cottages as they are to have underground dwellings. They tend to keep to themselves and ask the same of other races.

When encountered in groups there will likely be a leader, usually a 2nd level fighter, for every 30 individuals. In groups containing over 90 individuals there will likely be a 3rd level fighter as well. In groups containing more than 150 halflings there will usually be a 4th level fighter in addition to the 3rd and 2nd level fighters.

If the halflings are encountered in their homes there will likely be as many females as there are males. About 60% of these couples will have children. It is also expected that they will have 1d4 dogs acting as guards.

Halflings will usually wear leather or padded armour and they prefer a hand axe, club, spear, or sling as weapons. There is a 10% chance per level that higher level halflings may have magic armour and/or weapons.

Because of their natural resilience to both magic and poison, halflings save against these effects at four levels higher then they actually are. Also halflings are very adapt at sneaking and hiding. They will surprise on a roll of 1-4 on a d6. Halflings are so adept at using the natural camouflage that they should be considered invisible if there is any foliage to hide in.

Halflings speak their own language and will also be able to speak common, gnome, goblin, and orc.

A halfling has a rosy face with light brown to brown hair and brown to hazel eyes. Their clothes are simple earth colours, grey, tan, or brown.

Their lifespan averages about 150 years.

_Treasure:_ 3d8 sp per individual.

## Humanoids

“Humanoids” in OSRIC are evil-aligned manlike creatures such as orcs, goblins or kobolds. Most humanoids live in tribes or clans. Larger groups of these creatures will tend to include shamans or witch doctors (see “Tribal spell casters” at the beginning of this chapter).

Batrachians represent the more advanced frog-man tribes, and are typically armed with spear and shield or harpoon and shield (treat their harpoons as spears). Batrachians can have shamans (maximum of 5th level) or witch doctors (maximum of 5th/4th level).

**Optional:** If the Cthulhu mythos is in play, at least some batrachians may well worship Cthulhu. In this case they may be a lesser kind of Deep One.

There is a 25% chance that batrachians will have 2d4 giant frogs (75%) or poisonous giant frogs (25%) in their lair. Batrachians with poisonous giant frogs available may (50% chance) have anointed their spears or harpoons with poison.

Anurans represent the less advanced frog-man tribes, and typically do not possess weapons or armour. Anurans can have shamans (maximum of 3rd level) or witch doctors (maximum of 3rd/2nd level). They otherwise count as batrachians.

Females for both batrachians and anurans have the same stats. They are not normally combatant unless the efts (q.v.) or a temple, religious monument, or idol are threatened.

Efts are tadpoles. They are confined to water, and will always dwell in a large, central pool.

Rumours persist of batrachian ghouls, which may be under the shaman or witch doctor's command.

**Hop:** A hop counts as a charge, with an additional +1 “to hit” bonus. A batrachian making a hop attack with a spear or harpoon will inflict double damage. If not armed with a long weapon like a spear or harpoon, a batrachian will always lose initiative due to its clumsy movements on land.

Batrachians are well-camouflaged and can remain motionless for long periods. They are also cold-blooded and hence hard to see with infravision. As a result they surprise opponents 50% of the time, or 80% of the time if hopping.

If 30 or more batrachians are encountered at once, there will be 1d6 batrachian leaders with 2 HD. These larger batrachians have a strength bonus of +1 to damage.

_Treasure:_ 2d6 gp per individual, plus if encountered in their lair, a 20% chance of 1d3 pieces of jewellery and a 10% chance of 1d3 magic items.

**Bugbear**

Bugbears tend to form bands and live near goblins, a distant relative. Although bugbears have 60-ft infravision, they can live both above and below ground. Bugbears are quite stealthy and surprise at 50%; and a “hear noise” roll will not detect them.

Bugbears use a variety of weapons usually gathered from fallen opponents. These include axes, morning stars, hammers, swords, spears and missile weapons. Bugbear hunting parties (12+ creatures) always have a leader who fights as a 4 Hit Dice creature. (AC 4, 22-25 hp, and do 2d8+1 damage)

Within the lair there will be a chieftain and sub-chief as well as females and young. The chief is also a 4 Hit Dice creature with the following stats: (AC 3, 28-30 hp, 2d8+2 damage). The sub-chief fights as a leader.

If absolutely necessary, females fight as hobgoblins and young fight as kobolds. Each are equal in number to 50% of the male population.

Bugbears speak hobgoblin and goblin as well as chaotic evil and their own cursed speech.

_Treasure:_ 4d6 silver, 2d4 gold for individuals; 1d8×1,000 cp, 1d3×1,000 gp, 1d8 gems (30% chance), 1d4 jewellery (20% chance), miscellaneous magic weapon (10% chance)

Cavemen are primitive tribal humans living beyond the reach of normal civilisation. Hunting parties of cavemen(10 or more) are led by a 3rd level fighter. In their lair, in addition to the number of cavemen determined there will be a chief (5th level fighter) and 1d4 guards (4th level fighters). There is always a 10% chance (per every 10 cavemen) that a 3rd level cleric will be present (he or she is the tribal shaman).

They typically dwell in caves and cavern systems. Their treasure will consist of ivory tusks, gold nuggets, or uncut gems (5% chance per 10 cavemen present). If one is present, it will be the only treasure there. The value of each is 1,000 gp per ivory tusk (2d6 tusks), 5 gp gold nuggets (2d4×10), and 10 gp gems (1d%).

They favour spears, stone axes (treat as battle axes), and clubs (treat as morning stars) for weaponry. They add +1 to damage rolls due to their great strength.

They are frightened by the unknown and suffer a -1 to all morale checks.

**Tribesman:** Tribesmen are usually found in tropical jungles, or remote islands. They use large wooden shields, and have the same leadership as cavemen. In addition they will have the following:

-   One 4th level fighter per hunting party
    
-   One 6th level fighter per war party
    
-   One 8th level cleric/druid (at tribal lair, shaman).
    

They are usually armed with spears, shields, short bows, and clubs (treat as maces).

They typically dwell in villages made of crude huts.

_Treasure:_ See creature text.

**Gnoll**

Gnolls live and travel in small bands. They sometimes form loose alliances with other gnolls. They are very adaptive and can be found in most climes. There are rumours of a gnoll overlord, though if he exists his power and reach are limited.

Gnoll raiding parties will be led by a leader with 16 HP. He fights as a 3 HD monster.

Gnoll bands are led by a chieftain (AC 3, 22 HP, attacks as a 4 HD monster, and does 2d4+2 damage), and his 2d6 guards (AC 4, 20 HP, attack as 3 HD monster, 2d4+1 damage).

Gnolls have been known to ally with orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears, and even trolls. Gnolls have infravision (60-ft). They speak troll, their own barked tongue, chaotic evil, and occasionally orcish and hobgoblin.

_Description:_ Gnolls are large hyena-faced creatures. They are covered in a grey fur with a dark muzzle and yellow mane. They have dark eyes, and long nails. Their armour is usually a mismatch of types taken from their victims. They have a rough life, and their average lifespan is only 35 years.

_Treasure:_ Individual 2d6 ep, 2d4 gp; Lair 1d8×1,000 cp (60%), 1d6×1,000 sp (50%), 1d8×1,000 ep (35%), 1d6×1,000 gp (50%), 5d4 gems (30%), 1d6 jewellery (25%), 2d4 potions (40%)

Flinds are close relatives of, and to a degree resemble, gnolls. Flinds stand 6½-ft tall, with powerful limbs and a leonine head. Both flinds and gnolls regard flinds as more highly evolved beings and any gnoll will regard a flind as having 16 charisma. Groups of gnolls are often led by one or more flinds and the gnolls will obey any order given by a flind without question. A gnoll defending its flind leader will not check for morale unless the flind is killed or hors de combat. Flinds share a common language with gnolls and can also speak bugbear, hobgoblin, ogrish, and orcish. Flinds are generally on friendly terms with these humanoid races and will work with them as need arises. For unknown reasons, flinds do not like and will not cooperate with trolls.

In combat flinds swing crude clubs, using their great strength to gain +1 to hit. There is a 25% chance that each flind will wield a disarming weapon called a _flindbar_; a pair of iron bars linked by a short piece of chain. A flind wielding a flindbar gains two attacks per round for 1d4 hp damage. For every hit with a flindbar the victim must save vs aimed magic items or be disarmed.

If 20 or more flinds are encountered, there will be a leader type with 3+3 hit dice, a strength of 18 (+1 “to hit” and +2 damage), and a charisma of 18 to any gnoll he or she encounters. Leader type flinds always wield a flindbar in combat.

**Regarding PC use of the flindbar:** The wielder must be man-sized or larger and possess minimum ability scores of 13 in both strength and dexterity. The disarm function can only be used by PCs who select the flindbar as a weapon of proficiency.

_Treasure:_ 1d6 gp per individual; in lair: 1d6×1,000 cp (30%); 1d6×1,000 sp (25%); 2d4×1,000 ep (35%); 1d10×1,000 gp (45%); 1d4×100 pp (20%); 5d8 gems (50%); 4d12 jewellery (65%); 25% chance of any 3 maps or magic.

Goblins are tribal, with the strongest ruling the tribe. The tribes all owe fealty to the goblin king. Some think goblins are a distant cousin to kobolds, and like their cousins they prefer to live underground. They detest direct sunlight, and will fight at -1 if exposed to it. They have infravision with 60-ft range.

A goblin raiding party will be led by a captain and 4 sergeants, each with 7 hp and who will fight as orcs (1 HD monsters).

A goblin war party will be led by a sub-chief and his personal guards (2d4). They will fight as hobgoblins (each with 8 hp, AC 5, and doing 1d8 damage). There is a 1 in 4 chance that any war party will be mounted on worgs.

A goblin lair will be led by a chief and his personal guards (2d4). They will fight as gnolls (each with 12 hp, AC 4, doing 2d4 damage). Worgs are often used as guards of goblin lairs, and sometimes a small band of bugbears will be found there as well.

Goblins are good cavers and have a chance (25%) to note new or unusual construction.

Goblins have a deep racial hatred of gnomes and dwarfs and will attack them on sight.

Goblins speak kobold, orcish, hobgoblin, lawful evil, and their own foul tongue.

See also: Nilbog (under “Other Creatures”).

_Description:_ Goblins are small evil creatures with red eyes and a yellow to red coloured skin tone. They typically wear leather armour. They have an average lifespan of 50 years.

Grimlocks are a fierce race that dwell in the dark and hidden places of the earth, periodically issuing forth to the surface in search of prey, preferably human. Whilst somewhat resembling men in shape, they have a thick, almost scaly, hide that is a dusky grey in colour, a head of wild and matted black hair, a mouthful of vicious pointed teeth and two white featureless orbs for eyes.

Though it is unknown whether grimlocks speak a language, it is certain that they are entirely blind as a race. They instead rely on their other senses, which are highly developed and allow them to perceive the environment around them within a 20-ft radius with astounding accuracy. Their blindness also protects them against the effects of bright light or other visual stimuli that might otherwise adversely affect them, including magical effects, such as invisibility, darkness and any visual illusions. However, grimlocks are also known to be particularly vulnerable to effects that obscure their other senses, such as overpowering scents or overloud noises that have a significant duration. When exposed to such hindrances, their perception is reduced to a 10-ft radius and they suffer a -2 penalty to hit.

Grimlocks show very little grasp of tactics or strategy, preferring to attack directly and all at once. However, they do seem to prefer to fight under cover of darkness, which often yields to them a distinct advantage. Although they are capable of inflicting 1d6 damage with their filthy claws, most prefer to use axes or swords. Regardless of hit dice, grimlocks always make saving throws as 6th level fighters and have +1 to surprise rolls. Indeed, they are so well adapted to their environment that they are virtually undetectable when motionless, if initially unobserved.

For every 30 grimlocks encountered there will be one with 3 HD and AC 4; for every 40 grimlocks encountered there will be one with 4 HD and AC 3. These act as leaders, being generally more ferocious than their fellows and even capable of developing and employing elementary stratagems. For every one of these leaders present, their morale is increased by 5%. In their lairs will be found an equivalent number of females, each of which has 1 HD and AC 6, as well as a similar number of young, each of which has 1 hp and AC 6. It is rare for them to be found in conjunction with any other monsters.

_Treasure:_ 1d6×1,000 cp (25%), 1d4×1,000 sp (25%), 2d10×100 gp (25%), 1d8 gems (25%), 1d4 jewellery (25%) and 1 magic item (10%, armour or weapon only).

Hobgoblins live in tribal bands, and can be found in nearly any clime. They are bigger cousins of goblins and are not affected by sunlight. They have infravision (60-ft). They are competitive with other tribes and will sometimes make war on each other, unless controlled by a powerful leader.

Hobgoblin raiding parties are led by a sergeant and 2 assistants, each with 9 hp.

Hobgoblin war parties are led by a captain (AC 3, 16 hp, fights as a 3 HD monster, doing 1d8+2 damage).

In their lair, hobgoblins are led by a chief (AC 2, 22 hp, fights as a 4 HD monster, doing 1d10+1 damage) and 5d4 personal guards (AC 3, 16 hp, fights as a 3 HD monster, doing 1d8+2 damage).

Hobgoblins will typically lair underground and when they do they will sometimes keep carnivorous apes as guards.

Hobgoblins hate elves, and will attack them on sight.

Hobgoblins are very skilled miners and cavers, and can detect new construction, sloping passages and shifting walls with a 40% chance.

Hobgoblins speak goblin, orcish, their own brutish tongue and the very limited language of carnivorous apes. Some can speak common as well.

_Description:_ Hobgoblins are larger, hairier goblins with brown to grey fur. They have bright red or orange faces and yellow or brown coloured eyes. They have an average lifespan of 60 years.

_Treasure:_ Individual 3d12 cp, 2d8 gp; Lair 1d8×1,000 cp (75%), 1d12×1,000 sp (60%), 1d8×1,000 ep (35%), 1d6×1,000 gp (50%), 5d4 gems (50%), 1d6 jewellery (25%), 1 potion (15%)

Kobolds live in a tribal society. They tend to make their lairs in dark places such as caves or deep forests. They detest direct sunlight and fight at -1 if they are exposed to it. They have infravision which allows them to see well in total darkness (60-ft).

Kobold raiding parties are led by a sergeant and 2 assistants who fight as goblins. They tend to wield cheap weapons like slings or clubs in combat, and are typically unarmoured. Their AC results from their scaly hide.

Their lairs will be ruled by a chief and his 5d4 body guards (all fight as goblins). They often use wild boars or giant weasels to guard their lairs.

Kobolds are hateful creatures, but they especially despise brownies, pixies, sprites, and gnomes, which they will attack on sight.

These creatures speak lawful evil and their own tongue. Some also speak goblin.

_Description:_ Kobolds stand 3-ft tall and have a dark skin tone (brown to black), with no hair. They are vaguely reptilian in appearance with scales, small horns on their heads, short snaky tails and red eyes. They have an average lifespan of 135 years.

Lizard men are tribal, and often make their homes in underwater caves that contain air. They are semi-aquatic and require air to breathe. They are excellent swimmers, and will eat most anything, though they prefer human meat to all others.

There are a few tribes that are more highly evolved than others that will make their homes in crude villages and use shields for protection. These lizard men tribes also make use of barbed darts and javelins as missile weapons. They speak their own language.

_Description:_ Their hides are tough and leathery, and are coloured in many different shades of green. They have cold black eyes, and hard nails on their fingers. Some have a bony ridge along their backs.

Lizard men speak their own tongue, and a few (10%) can also speak common.

Orcs are fiercely tribal creatures, and will make war upon any neighbouring tribe if possible. They will only unite with other tribes if there is an external force strong enough to be able to control the leaders of the tribes.

Orcs suffer under direct sunlight, and fight at -1 when caught out in it. However, they have excellent vision in the dark, and can see well even in total darkness. They have infravision with 60-ft range.

Wandering orc war-parties are led by a captain and his personal guards (3d6). These orcs fight as 2 HD creatures, and have AC 4, 11 hp, and do 1d6+1 damage.

Orc chiefs will always be encountered in their lair. The chief and his personal guards (of which there are 5d6) fight as 3 HD monsters, and have AC 4, 15 hp, and do 2d4 damage.

Orcs are cruel, spiteful creatures and detest elves. They will attack elves on sight. They are known to take slaves of the other races, however.

Orcs are skilled miners and cavers. They have the ability to note new or unusual constructions underground 35% of the time, and to spot sloping passages 25% of the time.

Orcs speak goblin and hobgoblin in addition to their own foul tongue.

Most lairs will be found underground, and those found above ground will consist of simple huts, typically with some kind of defence (ditch, moat, crude walls, etc).

_Description:_ Orcs are filthy, disgusting creatures with a brown or brownish-green coloured skin tone. Their hair is a nest of black or dark brown. They wear rusty and misused armour. They have an average lifespan of 40 years.

Troglodytes are a tribal race of reptilians that make their lairs deep underground. They have infravision (90-ft range). They have an unnatural hatred of humans, and will attack them on sight.

Raiding parties (10 or more) will be led by a troglodyte that has 3 HD. War parties (20 or more) will be led by 2 creatures with 4 HD each. In their lair a chief will be present (he is a 6 HD monster) as well as 2d4 guards (3 hit dice creatures).

Some troglodytes attack with their claws and teeth, and some use weapons that they have taken in previous battles. They also have a special attack, once in combat they emit a sickening odour against which humans (as well as elves, half-elves, dwarfs, halflings, and gnomes) must save vs poison. If they fail, they lose 1 point of strength per round for 1d6 rounds. This effect lasts for 10 rounds after the last round it was active.

_Description:_ Troglodyte skin is normally a dark green colour. However, they have the ability to alter this colouration depending on the area around them (much like a chameleon). This ability allows them to surprise others on a 1-4. This surprise bonus does not work when they are emitting their odour. They have bony fins along their skulls, and dark reptilian eyes.

Treasure: Individual 2d6 ep; Lair 1d6×1,000 cp (25%), 1d6×1,000 sp (30%), 1d6×1,000 ep (35%), 1d10×1,000 gp (40%), 1d4×100 pp (25%), 4d10 gems (60%), 3d10 jewellery (50%), 3 magic items (30%)

## Giant

Far from being mere brutes, giants' cunning makes up for their sometimes low intelligence. Giants can sometimes be persuaded, so long it is within their interests, to cooperate with other beings of like alignment.

Despite their racial diversity, giants share some common characteristics. Giants are able to lift and throw large rocks like a catapult, even at close range, with their immense strength of 19-25. Immature giants function at a percent- age of that of adults.

Giants' great love of gold nearly matches their strength, and they commonly carry 1,000-6,000 coins, usually gold, with them when away from their cave dens. As if in defence of this treasure, they also commonly carry one or two rocks to use as convenient weapons.

Giants speak one language unique to their race, as well as their alignment language.

Cyclopes are extremely tall, ugly humanoids, each with a single eye centred under its slightly drooping brow. These oafish, antisocial creatures prefer to inhabit lonesome environs, such as out-of-the-way, otherwise deserted islands.

In addition to their single club attack, cyclopes may attack by hurling large boulders up to a distance of 60-ft.

Cloud giants usually live in giant castles at high elevations. When not high up in the mountains, their castles are on clouds given substance by magic. The majority (90%) of giants have average intelligence; the remainder are very intelligent and most often live in castles in the sky.

When multiple giants are found in a castle, there is a 75% chance that it is a family consisting of a male, a female, and any remaining giants encountered are their children. The children have an equal chance of being male or female. A female cloud giant is weaker than the male, resembling a fire giant in terms of damage inflicted and hit point capacity. Evil cloud giants keep 1 to 3 slaves 50% of the time and 1d4 prehistoric lions.

Very intelligent cloud giants have the ability to levitate the equivalent of 20,000 gp, plus their body weight, twice a day. Though they often wield clubs, all cloud giants can throw rocks to inflict 2d12 damage from 10 to 240-ft distance from a target, and can catch thrown rocks 60% of the time. Cloud giants are rarely (1 on 1d6) surprised due to their impressive olfactory abilities.

_Description:_ Cloud giants often dress in flowing clothing and fancy jewellery. They have bronze to white hair, with skin in tones of blue ranging from nearly white to cold, light blue.

Like cloud giants, fire giants often live in castles (50%), but are just as likely to frequent caves. It is not uncommon for many male fire giants to live together. When more than four fire giants are encountered, half the additional individuals will be female. When more than six fire giants are encountered, the additional individuals will be immature and will only have a percentage of adult capabilities. Females are not as formidable as males, and are comparable to frost giants in terms of attack damage and hit point capacity. As their name suggests, all fire giants are unharmed by fire. This extends to the flame breath produced by red dragons.

Like most giants, fire giants delight in throwing rocks at enemies. They can hit a target from a distance of 10-ft to 120-ft (2d10 hit points of damage), and can similarly catch (50% chance) thrown rocks. When not throwing rocks, fire giants wield large swords.

Fire giants sometimes share their lairs with hell hounds.

_Description:_ Fire giants' hair is the red and orange colour of flames, and their skin is soot black. Their teeth are flame orange, and their eyes red. The commonly wear armour on their broad, 6-ft wide shoulders. This armour is sometimes made from the skin of dragons.

Frost giants get their name from their love of the cold. They often live within frosty caverns, but also have a propensity to take up residence in castles, as do some of their other giant kin. This love of the cold is reflected in the fact that frost giants are completely immune to ill effects from cold, including the bone-chilling breath of white dragons.

Winter wolves often share residence with frost giants (50% chance, 1d6 in number). When encountering more than 4 frost giants, the first four are male and additional individuals up to 6 will be female. More than 6 will be immature and will only have a percentage of adult capabilities. Females are not as formidable as males, and are comparable to stone giants in terms of attack damage and hit point capacity.

Frost giants can cause 2d10 hit points in damage by throwing large rocks from between 10-ft to 200-ft. Likewise, they can catch rocks tossed at them with a 40% probability.

_Description:_ Frost giants have the overall appearance of giant, muscled barbarians. They have light yellow or blue eyes, with white hair that can likewise be tinged with yellow or blue.

Hill giants live in mostly inhospitable locations. Half of the time hill giants have other animals or beings guarding their homes. When guards are present, there is a 30% probability they are 1 to 3 giant lizards, 20% probability they are 2d4 ogres, and 50% probability they are 2d4 dire wolves. When encountering more than 4 hill giants, the first four are male and additional individuals up to 7 will be female. More than 7 will be immature and will only have a percentage of adult capabilities. Females have 6 HD and are not as formidable as males. They are comparable to ogres in terms of attack and damage.

Hill giants can cause 2d8 hit points in damage by throwing large rocks from between 10-ft to 200-ft. Likewise, they can catch rocks tossed at them with a 30% probability.

_Description:_ In many ways hill giants resemble larger ogres, including having eyes red-rimmed, and they will often wield some type of bludgeoning weapon. In fact, hill giants frequently (50%) also speak the language of ogres. They have skin of rust brown or tan, with similarly coloured rust or black hair. They dress in animal skins.

Stone giants live in mountainous locations exclusively in caverns or otherwise in the earth. They are most active at night. Three-quarters of the time stone giants have 1d4 cave bears guarding their homes. When encountering more than 4 stone giants, the first four are male and additional individuals up to 6 will be female. More than 6 will be immature and will only have a percentage of adult capabilities. Females are not as formidable as males, and are comparable to hill giants in terms of attack, damage, and hit points.

Stone giants sometimes share their lairs with cave bears.

Stone giants can cause 3d10 hit points in damage by throwing large rocks from between 10 to 300-ft. Likewise, they can catch rocks tossed at them with a 90% probability.

_Description:_ Stone giants are partially named for their stone-like complexions and iron coloured eyes. Their hair is also dark-stone coloured, sometimes with hints of blue. Whereas hill giants often use wooden clubs, stone giants prefer stone and wear skins the colour of stone.

Storm giants are the most formidable of giants in many campaigns. They live in remote locations; about 60% of the time they live on clouds like their cloud giant cousins, and 30% of the time in the mountains like their stone giant relatives. Somewhat more rarely (10% of the time) storm giants choose to live underwater. In all cases, they live in immense, luxurious castles. Like other giants, storm giants have a fondness for pets and if living above water will have 1d4 griffons 30% of the time and 1 or 2 rocs 70% of the time. However, storm giants who have their castle abodes under water will instead have 2d4 sea lions.

Storm giants are too intelligent, sophisticated, and magically endowed to toss rocks like their brethren. Instead, storm giants can employ the following spell-like abilities once per day: _lightning bolt_ (8d8 damage), _call lightning_ (10 to 15d6 damage, 3 bolts), _control winds_, _predict weather_, and _weather summoning_. Further, they can _levitate_ their own weight plus an additional weight equal to 30,000 gold pieces two times per day. Storm giants can breathe and otherwise function underwater unimpeded. They are immune to all damage by electricity, including the fearsome electrical bolt breathed by the dreaded blue dragon.

_Description:_ There are two typical appearances of storm giants, related to their preference for environment. Those who choose to live underwater are often of green hair, eyes and skin, while those above water have purple skin, eyes either purple or cloudy grey, and blue-tinted black hair.

Ettins are large, nocturnal creatures that live below ground. They have two heads, each of which controls one arm. The right side is slightly dominant, and can cause 3d6 damage whereas the left can inflict 2d8. Ettins are seldom surprised because one head or the other is usually keeping watch.

_Description:_ Ettins are dirty creatures that wear tattered skins and often use wicked weapons, such as barbed clubs. They share some affinity to orcs, witnessed in their pig-like faces.

Ogres are malicious beings who live in all environments, whether above or below ground. They have affinity with hill giants and trolls, and often can be found with them. Additionally, ogres love wealth, and will hire themselves out to other creatures toward this end.

In a group of 11 or more ogres, one is a leader and is slightly more powerful (attack capability equal to a 7 HD monster, 33 hit points, AC 3, and damage of 2d6). Groups of 16 or greater ogres will have two of these leaders, as well as an ogre chief. The chief also attacks as a 7 HD monster, but inflicts 1d10+4 hit points of damage and has an AC of 4. When attacking by weapon, standard ogres receive +2 to damage while their more powerful leaders get +3 and a chief receives +4.

When encountering ogres in their lair, there will be an additional 2d6 females and 2d4 young. Females deliver 2d4 hit points of damage and have 4d6+1 hit points. Children have the same capabilities as goblins. The lair will contain slaves or prisoners 30% of the time. When capturing other beings, 25% of the time they are used as slaves where as the unlucky majority, or 75%, find their way to the supper table.

Despite their low intelligence, ogres are social creatures and speak orc, troll, and the language of hill giants in addition to their own language and alignment tongue.

_Description:_ Aside from the elusive unhealthy purple coloured ogre, most ogres have skin that is dull yellow or dark brown. They have black-green or blue-black hair, and their skin is covered in dark wart-like bumps. They have purple eyes and white pupils, and their hard, thick nails and teeth are orange and sometimes black. Ogres live at least 90 years. They don furs or other animal hides, and their (often) mercenary lifestyle requires that they maintain their weapons and armour in decent condition.

_Treasure:_ Individual: 20d4 gp; Lair: 1d3×1,000 gp (30%), 5d8 gems (40%), 2 magic items (10%), 2d4 potions (40%)

Ogre Magi are fearsome evil creatures, well versed in magic and of unnatural size and strength. They stand around nine or ten feet tall, are thick-limbed, wide of girth and heavily muscled, but otherwise more or less resemble men in shape. Ogre magi are known to have thick skin that usually ranges in colour from pale yellow to brown or black, but some are said to be green or even blue. Most have reddish coloured eyes, two or more yellow to white horns, thick tusks, sharp yellow to black nails and long dark hair. They speak common and ogrish, amongst other languages.

Though ogre magi are physically powerful, it is their command of magic that makes them truly dangerous adversaries. The spells they may use include _fly_ (12 turn duration), _invisibility_, _darkness, 10-ft radius_ and _polymorph self_, though this last is limited to humanoid forms 4-ft to 12-ft in size. Once per day, they may also use _charm person_, _sleep_, _gaseous form_ and _cone of cold_ as a 12th level spell caster.

In addition, they have the capacity to regenerate 1 hp per combat round. Ogre magi are highly intelligent and will seek to defeat their foes with magic before entering physical combat. They prefer to flee rather than continue to fight a losing battle, though they are known to bear long grudges.

Ogre magi are not numerous and tend towards small groups, but the largest are led by particularly powerful individuals with 30-42 hp who fight and save as though they had 9 hit dice. Their lairs are generally defended and often guarded by lesser beings who have been forced into their service.

Treasure: 2d10×1,000 gp (50%), 1d10×1,000 pp (50%), 3d6 gems (25%), 1d6 jewellery (25%), 1d6 potions (100%) and 1d6 magic items (25%)

Trolls are vile, putrid creatures found in almost any climate. They can attack up to three opponents at a time using their powerful limbs to claw and their wicked teeth for biting. After three rounds of combat, their innate regeneration ability will start working, recovering 3 hit points per round. Their ability to regenerate even allows detached limbs to reattach to their body. Severed limbs will even continue to attack foes independently. A troll can only be truly destroyed by fire or acid, and these type of damage cannot be regenerated.

_Description:_ The hides of trolls are a sickly green or grey and they have cold black eyes.

_Treasure:_ Lair 1d8×1,000 cp (10%), 1d12×1,000 sp (15%), 1d8×1,000 ep (15%), 1d6×1,000 gp (50%), 1d10 gems (30%), 1d6 jewellery (25%), 2 magic items or 1 potion (15%).

These horrible creatures are the result of crossbreeding trolls with hill giants, resulting in a monster that looks like a troll combined with the large size and pot-belly of a hill giant. The hide of a giant troll is reddish brown and they have tough wiry black hair, bulbous nose, and red rimmed eyes.

Giant trolls are very strong and when fighting with their favoured weapon, a giant spiked club, they inflict 2d8 points of damage. They carry this weapon with them everywhere, even in their lair, but if encountered without it they will fight with their clawed hands. When using their natural weaponry giant trolls attack twice per round for 1d6 points of damage each, and is easily capable of attacking two different targets in the same round. Giant trolls also have extremely fast reflexes and are able to snatch a missile from the air 25% of the time. If it is a missile suitable for throwing (example: spear, rock) the giant troll will throw it back as its next attack.

Giant trolls regenerate 2 hp per round but unlike their smaller cousins, they are not capable of rebonding severed limbs, and severed limbs will not attack independently. Giant trolls share a troll's weakness to fire and acid, and at least 10 hp of damage to a troll must be by one of these two methods before it can be slain. Any other damage simply reduces the giant troll to 1 hp and negates regeneration.

Giant trolls are found in every climate except desert. They have 90-ft infravision and an acute sense of smell as well as the troll's racial trait of absolute fearlessness.

Treasure: 2d6×1,000 cp (20%), 1d6×1,000 sp (35%), 1d4×1,000 ep (15%), 1d6 gems (25%), 1d4 jewellery (25%), any 2 maps or magic (10%)

Giant two-headed trolls are the vicious offspring of trolls and ettins. In appearance they look most like trolls, though they have two heads like an ettin and prefer wearing filthy animal skins as ettins do. Giant two-headed trolls are nocturnal and prefer underground dwellings such as dungeons or caverns, but only have the standard 60-ft infravision.

In combat the giant two-headed troll has two claw attacks for 1d6 points of damage each and which can be directed at two different opponents. It also has two bite attacks for 1d10 damage each but bite attacks must be directed at the same opponent. This variety of troll can regenerate 1 hp per round but cannot rebond severed limbs, and severed limbs will not attack independently. Like an ettin, this ettin-troll crossbreed can have one head sleep while the others stays alert for danger and thus it can only be surprised on a 1 in 6.

Treasure: 1d8×1,000 cp (20%), 1d10×1,000 sp (30%), 1d10×1,000 ep (15%), 1d6×1,000 gp (60%), 2d6 gems (35%), 1d6 jewellery (20%), any 2 maps or magic plus 1 potion (25%)

An ice troll has the general form of a troll but its cold, semi-transparent body seems to have been chiselled from blue-tinged ice. Ice trolls prefer underground dwellings such as dungeons or caverns and will always lair near running water if possible or, failing that, the wettest spot they can find. These trolls regenerate 2 hp per round and are capable of rebonding severed limbs, but only if the limb is immersed in water. A severed limb will move toward the nearest body of water if one is within 30-ft. Severed limbs will not attack independently.

In combat, ice trolls attack with two claw attacks for 1d8 points of damage apiece. As with other types of trolls, these attacks can be directed at two different opponents. Ice trolls can only be hit with magical weapons and are immune to cold based attacks of any kind. Fire inflicts double damage upon ice trolls.

Ice trolls have the superior 90-ft infravision and an acute sense of smell. They also share the racial traits of most troll types, having great strength, being fearless in combat, and attacking until either victorious or slain.

Treasure: 1d10×1,000 cp (10%), 1d20×1,000 sp (20%), 1d6×1,000 ep (10%), 1d8×1,000 gp (40%), 1d12 gems (25%), 1d8 jewellery (25%)

Long ago these creatures were created in some bizarre and perverted arcane ritual merging the life essences of a troll and some extra-planar creature. Fewer than 50 of these creatures are believed to exist and the secret of their creation process died with the creators when the spectral trolls rose up in revolt and fed upon their life energy. Spectral trolls are invisible. Anyone able to see invisible will see a monster that appears very much like a shorter-than-normal troll with somewhat indistinct features and glowing amber eyes.

Spectral trolls have 3 attacks which cause special damage (detailed below) and can target up to 3 different opponents if they choose. Spectral trolls regenerate 3 hit points per round and can rebond severed limbs and, as with their troll brethren, severed limbs will continue to attack independently. These creatures are impervious to cold and cold based attacks while fire or fire based attacks cause damage which does not regenerate. Spectral trolls can only be hit by magical weapons.

**Special Damage**: The spectral troll has two claw attacks that subtract 1d3 points of damage on a successful hit from both the victim's hp and his or her strength ability score. For example: a 17 strength fighter struck for 2 hit points of damage will immediately be reduced to a strength of 15. Strength is recovered at a rate of 1 point for every 2d4 turns. If a victim's strength is reduced to zero he or she dies; if strength is reduced to 1 or 2 hit points the victim will fall comatose to the ground and will not recover consciousness until enough strength is recovered to raise score to 3 or higher.

In addition to the special claw attacks, the spectral troll also has a fanged biting attack. The bite attack of one of these invisible monsters inflicts 1d6 points of damage but the troll adds its own hit point value as bonus damage to the attack. Example: a spectral troll with 38 hit points bites a cleric for 4 points of damage. Total damage dealt to the unfortunate cleric would 4+38 = 42.

Spectral trolls have an acute sense of smell and superior infravision with a 120-ft range. Like all trolls, the spectral troll is strong, fearless, and attacks relentlessly until it kills its opponent or is itself slain.

_Treasure:_ Nil.

## Dragons

Dragons are, in many ways, the archetypal adversaries in OSRIC-compatible games. Some dragons are weak enough that even a relatively low level party can have a chance to fight a dragon—while others are powerful enough to pose a challenge even to a high-level party. Even parties of very high average level may well struggle to defeat a mated pair, or family group, of elder dragons!

Dragons come in various colours. In many campaigns, these colours are literal—fire-breathing dragons really do always have red scales—but in others, they may be metaphorical, allowing (for example) a green or brown “red” dragon. Some campaigns also allow the possibility of dragons with more than 8 hp per die and dragons with d10, d12 or even larger Hit Die are possible.

There are some traits that are generally common to all dragons, no matter the colour or alignment. First, if issued with a formal challenge, a dragon will sometimes agree to fight until subdued rather than to the death. The GM should rule about the likelihood of the dragon's acceptance and the conditions that apply, since these will depend on the nature of the challenge and the alignment of the dragon. Second, dragons grow more powerful as they age. Generally, a newly-hatched dragon should be given 1 hp per die, while a very ancient one (defined as being in excess of 400 years of age) will have 8. Third, dragons radiate an aura of fear (as the 4th level magic user spell) affecting creatures of less than 5th level unless they save vs magic. Last, dragons with 5 or more hp per die gain a bonus of +1 to their saving throw rolls per hp/die in excess of 4. Thus an ancient dragon with 8 hp per die saves at +4.

Viking champions such as Ragnar Lodbrok and Sigurd the Volsung fought fearsome dragons that spewed a corrosive venom, deadly to the touch. These dragons are the deadly black dragons. Black dragons are found mostly in swamps, marshes and deep, dark caves.

Black dragons only occasionally (30%) are known to speak, only rarely (10%) cast magic, but often (50%) will be found asleep. If the dragon is asleep, there is a 1 in 6 chance that it will awaken in the presence of adventurers. Dragons also sometimes feign sleep.

If a black dragon can cast spells, it will gain spells as a magic user of a level equal to one half of its age category. So, an ancient black dragon casts as a 4th level magic user.

Black dragon breath is a stream of corrosive, acidic venom, 50-ft long×5-ft wide. It does damage equal to the dragon's hit points (but a save vs dragon breath halves this amount). The dragon may use this breath weapon up to three times per day.

The blue dragons of the desert must contend with their deadly rivals, the brass dragons, who love the same arid caves. The brass dragons are not the vicious killers that the blue dragons are, although their good nature is sometimes overcome with doses of greed and self-interest.

Brass dragon breath is either a cone of _sleep_\-inducing gas (70-ft×20-ft), or a cone of _fear_ gas (40-ft×50-ft,×20-ft).

Anyone within the cloud must save or fall deeply asleep or run in fear (duration of either effect is 10 minutes). Saves against a small dragon's breath are at a +2, but against a large dragon's breath are at a -2.

Green dragons sometimes (45%) speak, rarely (20%) cast magic, and will sometimes (40%) be found asleep. If the dragon is asleep, there is a 1 in 6 chance that it will awaken in the presence of adventurers. Dragons also sometimes feign sleep.

If a green dragon can cast spells, it will do so as a magic user equal to its age category. Thus a green dragon with 6 hit points per die can cast spells as if it were a 6th level magic user. Owing to the magical nature of the creature, it does not require somatic or material components to its spells—it need only speak the incantation.

Green dragon breath is a cloud of toxic gas, 50-ft long, 40-ft wide, and 30-ft high. The dragon may use this breath weapon up to three times per day.

_Treasure:_ (For a typical individual) 5d6×1,000 cp (25%), 1d100×1,000 sp (40%), 1d4×10,000 ep (40%), 1d6×10,000 gp (55%), 5d10×100 pp (25%), 1d100 gems (50%), 1d4×10 jewellery (50%), 4 magic items plus 1 potion and 1 scroll (15%), 2d4 potions (40%), 1d4 scrolls (50%).

The archetypal red dragon is Smaug from “The Hobbit.”

Red dragons usually (80%) speak, sometimes (40%) cast magic, and will sometimes (20%) be found asleep. If the dragon is asleep, there is a 1 in 6 chance that it will awaken in the presence of adventurers. Dragons also sometimes feign sleep.

If a red dragon can cast spells, it will do so as a magic user equal to its age category. Thus a red dragon with 6 hit points per die can cast spells as if it were a 6th level magic user. Owing to the magical nature of the creature, it does not require somatic (hand gestures) or material components to its spells—it need only speak the incantation.

Red dragon breath is a cone of flame, 90-ft long and 15-ft radius at the base, emanating from the mouth of the creature. It does damage equal to the dragon's hit points (but a save vs dragon breath halves this amount). The dragon may use this breath weapon up to three times per day.

_Treasure:_ (For a typical individual) 5d6×1,000 cp (25%), 1d100×1,000 sp (40%), 1d4×10,000 ep (40%), 1d6×10,000 gp (55%), 5d10×100 pp (25%), 1d100 gems (50%), 1d4×10 jewellery (50%), 4 magic items plus 1 potion and 1 scroll (15%), 2d4 potions (40%), 1d4 scrolls (50%).

Dwelling in high places such as mountaintops or among the clouds, like gold dragons, silver dragons epitomize law and goodness. They are interested in the ways of man and often use shape-changing powers to watch, observe and help people. They prefer to have their lairs in places isolated from prying eyes, however, and thus often place their entrances in lakes or ponds. They have found that their treasure hordes are tempting targets for evil or even neutral adventurers.

Silver dragons usually speak (75%), and if they can speak, usually (75%) cast magic. Occasionally (15%), they will be found asleep. If the dragon is asleep, there is a 1 in 6 chance that it will awaken in the presence of adventurers.

Dragons also sometimes feign sleep.

A silver dragon gains spells as if it were a wizard of a level equal to its age category.

Silver dragon breath is a blast of frost (like that of a white dragon) or a cloud of paralysing gas (like a green dragon except those who fail their saves are paralysed for 3d4 turns), at the dragon's option. The dragon may use breath weapons up to three times per day.

Treasure: (For a typical individual) 5d6×1,000 cp (25%), 1d100×1,000 sp (40%), 1d4×10,000 ep (40%), 1d6×10,000 gp (55%), 5d10×100 pp (25%), 1d100 gems (50%), 1d4×10 jewellery (50%), 4 magic items plus 1 potion and 1 scroll (15%), 1d4 scrolls (50%).

Almost the antithesis of the fiery red dragon is the frost-rimed white dragon of the frigid north. Although lesser than their red cousins in size, power and intelligence, they are at least as evil.

White dragons only rarely (20%) are known to speak, very rarely (5%) cast magic, but frequently (60%) will be found asleep. If the dragon is asleep, there is a 1 in 6 chance that it will awaken in the presence of adventurers. Dragons also sometimes feign sleep.

If a white dragon can cast spells, it will gain spells as a magic user of a level equal to one half of its age category. So, an ancient white dragon casts as a 4th level magic user.

White dragon breath is a cone of deadly frost, 50-ft long and 25-ft diameter at the base. It does damage equal to the dragon's hit points (but a save vs breath weapons halves this amount). The dragon may use this breath weapon up to three times per day.

Treasure: (For a typical individual) 1d12×1,000 cp (15%), 1d20×1,000 sp (25%), 1d6×1,000 ep (25%), 1d8×1,000 gp (25%), 1d12 gems (15%), 1d8 jewellery (10%), 3 magic items plus 2d4 potions and 1 scroll (25%).

## Demons

Demonologists have identified several classes of demon. Each class of demon possesses a variety of powerful, supernatural abilities. Those abilities common to all demons are noted below. For further information on both the classified and unclassified demons, see the individual demon listings. Note that most demons do not actually fall into the six listed categories.

Many demons possess the following magical abilities: _infravision_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _teleport_ (with no chance of error) (as the 5th level magic user spell), _darkness_ and _gate_ (as the 9th level magic user spell). See individual listings for details.

Demons can freely travel between their own home planes and Tarterus, Pandemonium and Hades. They may also travel the Astral Plane at will. However, they are only able to enter the Prime Material Plane if summoned with a spell (_conjuration_, _gate_, _wish_, etc.) or certain magical items.

Demons are all extremely and decidedly chaotic evil (see “Alignment”). Demonic society is highly competitive and always favours the strong over the weak.

In combat, demons are fearless and the less intelligent among them will attack mindlessly until slain.

They are immune to subdual attacks and may simultaneously attack as many opponents as their abilities allow.

Being supremely chaotic, demons will never willingly serve another. If compelled into service through magical or other means, they will always seek a way to either kill or enslave their master, or at the very least, subvert the terms of their summoning. While demons may be summoned by higher-level PCs, they will prove highly difficult to control. Thaumaturgic circles are proof against demons, but require increasingly complex preparation and materials for the more powerful sorts. Often summoning will entail either a threat of punishment or a reward. These should be considered carefully by the GM during play and should always carry an element of risk for the summoner.

Demons are repulsed by good artifacts or other powerful holy items.

On the Prime Material Plane, demons may be turned by clerics of levels 8+ and paladins of levels 11+.

Babau are also known by demonologists as horned demons or bone demons. They are around 7-ft tall and look like skeletons covered in a leathery black skin. The babau's feet, taloned hands and head are grossly oversized, nearly the same as a hill giant's. From the base of its skull protrudes a hooked horn.

These demons are known for their cunning intelligence and strength (19). In combat, they prefer to use any sort of weaponry if it is to their advantage. In the heat of battle, they secrete a slimy rust coloured ichor that halves damage from melee weapons, as blows slide off their bodies. Their typical mode of attack involves leaping from above onto unwary victims

Babau are immune to normal melee and missile weapons. Iron weapons inflict an additional +2 damage as it burns their hide. Magical weapons are also effective, but do not impart this +2 bonus.

Babau cause _darkness_ at will (5-ft radius) and have abilities equal to a 9th level thief. They also have the following abilities which they can use at will one at a time as a 14th level spell caster: _fear_ (touch only, otherwise as the 4th level magic user spell), _levitate_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _fly_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _dispel magic_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _polymorph self_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), _heat metal_ (as the 2nd level druid spell), or _gate_ (as the 9th level magic user spell) in another babau (25% chance of success). Finally, anyone up to 20-ft away gazing into the eyes of a babau must save vs spells (unlisted categories) or suffer the effects of a _ray of enfeeblement_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell).

Babau are despised by class A, B and C demons. Class D demons especially hate bands of babau, and hunt them for food.

_Treasure:_ If encountered in their lair, babau will have amassed a hoard made up of 1d12×1000 cp (20%), 1d6×1000 sp (30%), 1d4×1000 ep (10%), 1d6 gems (25%) and 1d3 jewellery (20%). In addition, they may (10%) have 1d2 magical items.

**Class A Demon (Vrock)**

Vrock, considered one of the weakest of demonkind, look like a hideous cross between a vulture and a humanoid. They are no stronger than normal and may be harmed with normal melee and missile weapons. Like all demons they can cause _darkness_, but only in a 5-ft radius. They also possess the following special abilities which they may use at will: _detect_ _invisibility_ (objects only, otherwise as per the 2nd level magic user spell), _gate_ in another vrock (10% chance of success), or _telekinesis_ (as the 5th level magic user spell, up to 200 lbs).

Vrock are particularly stupid, and cannot normally be bargained with. They love the sight of precious gems and jewellery, however, and also enjoy feasting on the flesh of men.

_Treasure:_ If encountered in their lair, they will possess a hoard of 1d8×1,000 cp (50%), 1d6×1,000 sp (25%), 1d4×1,000 ep (25%), 1d3×1,000 gp (25%), 1d8 gems (30%), 1d4 jewellery (20%) and possibly a magical weapon (10%).

**Class B Demon (Hezrou)**

Slightly shorter than the vrock, the hezrou resemble loathsome toads with humanoid arms. They are vulnerable to normal melee and missile weapons. They cause _darkness_ at will covering a 15-ft radius. They also possess the following special abilities which can be used at will, one at a time; cause _fear_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), _levitate_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _detect invisibilit_y (objects only, otherwise as per the 2nd level magic user spell), _telekinesis_ (as per the 5th level magic user spell, up to 300 lbs), or _gate_ (as the 9th level magic user spell) another hezrou (20% chance of success).

Hezrou and vrock will gladly fight each other without hesitation, and they both share a love of human flesh.

_Treasure:_ If encountered in their lair, hezrou will have a pile of treasure including 1d12×1,000 cp (20%), 1d6×1,000 sp (30%), 1d4×1,000 ep (10%), 1d6 gems (25%) and 1d3 jewellery (20%). In addition, they might (10%) have 1d2 random magical items.

These muscular demons have a head like a horned dog, and from their broad chest sprouts four arms: 2 with sharp pincers and 2 with hands. Glabrezu are vulnerable to normal melee weapons and missiles. At will, they can cause _darkness_ in a 10-ft radius. Additionally, they may use the following abilities at will, one at a time; cause _fear_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), _levitate_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _pyrotechnics_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell ), _polymorph self_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), _telekinesis_ (as the 5th level magic user spell, up to 400 lbs), _gate_ (as the 9th level magic user spell) another Class A to C demon (30% chance of success).

_Treasure:_ If encountered in their lair, glabrezu will have a cache of treasure made up of 1d8×1,000 cp (10%), 1d12×1,000 sp (15%), 1d8×1,000 ep (15%), 1d6×1,000 gp (50%), 1d10 gems (30%), 1d6 jewellery (25%), and 3 random magic items, including one potion (15%).

Particularly malevolent demons, the class D have the upper body of an ape and the cloven-hoofed lower body of a boar. They have rather small feathered wings as well, which seem undersized compared to their corpulent bodies. Unlike class A to C demons, these are immune to normal arms and must be attacked with magical weapons. Like other demonkind, they are able to cause _darkness_ at will (10-ft radius). Their other abilities, which they can use at will, one at a time, are _improved phantasmal force_ (as the 2nd level illusionist spell), _fear_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), _levitate_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _detect magic_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _comprehend languages_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _dispel magic_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _polymorph self_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), _telekinesis_ (as the 5th level magic user spell, up to 500 lbs), _project image_ (as the 6th level magic user spell), use a _symbol of fear_ or _discord_ (as the 8th level magic user spell), and _gate_ (as the 9th level magic user spell) another class A to D demon (random class, 60% chance of success).

Certain class D demons have their own secret names, which makes it 90% certain they will answer a summons if it is spoken. Conjurers should be prepared to make impressive promises of treasure, magical items or living sacrifices when summoning a class D demon, especially by name. It should also be remembered that these demons particularly enjoy feasting on human blood and meat.

_Treasure:_ In the Abyss, these demons hoard the treasure they have acquired through service or other means. An individual nalfeshnee's trove will include 1d10×1,000 cp (5%), 1d12×1,000 sp (15%), 1d6×1,000 ep (25%), 1d8×1,000 gp (25%), 1d12 gems (15%), and 1d8 jewellery (10%). In addition, they have a 25% chance of possessing 3 random magic items and 1 scroll.

**Class E Demon (Marilith and others)**

Infamous even among demonkind for their cruel and ill-tempered nature, the marilith are invariably female. From the waist up they appear to be a full-figured human female with six arms and skin tones ranging from deep violet to a putrescent green. Below the waist however, they have the coiling body of a large serpent. In melee they prefer to wield a variety of barbed and hooked swords and battle axes or simply constrict their prey with their powerful serpentine tail.

Like their fellow demons, they can cause _darkness_ at will (5-ft radius). They possess the following additional abilities which they may use one at a time, at will: _charm person_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _levitate_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _comprehend languages_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _detect invisibility_ (objects only, otherwise as the 2nd level magic user spell), _pyrotechnics_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell ), _polymorph self_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), _project image_ (as the 6th level magic user spell), or _gate_ (as the 9th level magic user spell) another demon (50% chance of success.) Use the following table to determine which class of demon is summoned:

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>d%</strong></td><td><strong>Demon Class</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1-30</td><td>Class A</td></tr><tr><td>31-55</td><td>Class B</td></tr><tr><td>56-70</td><td>Class C</td></tr><tr><td>71-85</td><td>Class D</td></tr><tr><td>86-00</td><td>Class F</td></tr></tbody></table>

All class E demons have personal and secret names which may be used to summon and bargain with them, much like class D demons. They reportedly prefer the sacrifice of powerful male warriors as payment.

_Treasure:_ On their home plane, these demons hoard the treasure they have acquired through service or other means. Their cache will include 10d4×1000 gp (50%), 1d20×100 pp (50%), 5d4 gems (30%), 1d10 jewellery (10%), and 4 random magical items and a scroll (35%).

Reportedly only six of this class of demon exist, each with their own secret name. In combat they wield massive _**+1 swords**_ and a cat-o-nine-tails whip which they employ to drag their victims into the flames that they continually immolate themselves in. Each round, there is a 4 in 6 chance they will use their whip. Victims who fail a save vs spells (unlisted categories) are burnt by the flames and suffer 4d6 additional points of damage.

The _darkness_ they cause at will has a radius of 10-ft. In addition, they have several other abilities which they can use at will one at a time. These are fear (as the 4th level magic user spell), _detect magic_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _read magic_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _comprehend languages_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _detect invisibility_ (objects only, otherwise as the 2nd level magic user spell), _pyrotechnics_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell ), _dispel magic_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _suggestion_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _telekinesis_ (as the 5th level magic user spell, up to 600 lbs), use a _symbol of fear_, _discord_, _sleep_, or _stunning_ (as the 8th level magic user spell), and _gate_ (as the 9th level magic user spell) another demon of class C (80% chance) or class D (20% chance) with a 70% chance of success.

Summoning class F demons requires significant offerings or future promises of service or sacrifice. If negotiation is successful, they might be persuaded to aid the summoner or associated group for a while. In any case, these demons will always try to bully and intimidate their masters in an effort to usurp leadership, which they crave. Many other chaotic evil monsters and demons are attracted to the aura of charismatic evil that surrounds class F demons, so they are often found in the forefront of evil hordes.

_Treasure:_ If encountered in their lair, they will have a cache of treasure equal to 1d20×1,000 sp (10%), 1d12×1,000 ep (15%), 1d10×1,000 gp (40%), 1d8×100 pp (35%), 3d10 gems (20%), and 1d10 jewellery (10%). They may (30%) also have 1 potion, 1 scroll, and 3 other magical items (no weapons).

Demonettes are the result of union between a succubus and a human male. Their individual appearances vary, but their vestigial horns and small leathery bat-like wings denote their demonic heritage. Most favour their demonic mother and revel in chaotic evil. A minority (20%) harbour less demoniacal inclinations. Nevertheless, they may never be lawful or good.

Demonettes are invulnerable to normal melee and missile weapons. Only iron and magic weapons can harm them. Demonettes have a natural base armour class of 5. Wearing mundane armours cannot improve this. Magical armours or other protections add only their bonus, unless the armour is superior to AC 5, in which case the full benefit is accrued. In addition, demonettes may have a bonus for high dexterity, as do humans.

In melee, demonettes may wield any sort of weapon regardless of any class restrictions (see spell casting abilities below).

All demonettes have the following special abilities, which they may use three times per day as a 12th level magic user: _charm person_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), ESP (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _polymorph self_ (humanoid shapes only, otherwise as the 4th level magic user spell), and _suggestion_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell).

In addition, they can use _dimension door_ (as the 4th level magic user spell) once per day.

Fully 25% of all demonettes have genius level intelligence. These demonettes are able to memorise and cast spells as a 1st to 12th level magic user (1d12 to determine level). Spell casting abilities are in addition to their other innate abilities noted above.

Finally, much like their succubus parent, demonettes are able to drain a victims life energy with a touch (a “to hit” roll is required in combat). Each touch drains 1d8 hit points from the victim and adds 1d4 hit points to the demonette.

Demonettes also possess a superior infravision that has a range of 120-ft.

_Treasure:_ Demonettes normally care little for coins. They love gems, jewellery and magical items however. If found in their lair, a demonette will have a cache that contains 1d4 random scrolls (50%), 2d4 random potions (40%), 1d8×10 gems (90%), 5d6 jewellery (80%) and 1d6 other random magical items (excluding potions and scrolls, 70%).

Demoniacs are the result of a mating between a major demon and a human female (cf. demonette). As such, each is slightly different depending upon parentage. Generally, demoniacs are strong and heavily-built. They will usually have several other demonic characteristics as well, such as vestigial horns, barbs, or scaled skin.

Demoniacs have a natural base armour class of 6. Wearing mundane armours cannot improve this. Magical armours or other protections add only their bonus, unless the armour is superior to AC 6, in which case the full benefit is accrued. In addition, demoniacs may have a bonus for high dexterity, as do humans. Demoniacs, as a virtue of their parentage, are invulnerable to silver weapons. They may be injured by normal weapons and magical weapons. Iron weapons do double damage to them.

**Demoniac Ability Scores;**

Strength 1d3+16 Intelligence 1d8+8 Dexterity 1d8+12 Wisdom 3d6

Iron weapons do double damage to them.

All demoniacs have infravision. They are also able to communicate with demons.

Demoniacs may become clerics, attaining a maximum level equal to their hit dice (usually of an Archdemon or other evil deity). If their intelligence allows, demoniacs may become magic users, although they may attain a maximum of 5th level of ability. They may also choose to become a thief or an assassin, up to a maximum of their hit dice in ability level.

_Treasure:_ As for demonettes, but the GM should re-roll items that are not appropriate to the demoniac's class(es). If the second roll yields an item that the demoniac still could not use, it should be allowed to stand.

**Dretch**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency:</strong></td><td>Common</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. Encountered:</strong></td><td>2d4 or 5d4 (in the Abyss)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size:</strong></td><td>Small</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Move:</strong></td><td>90-ft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Armour Class:</strong></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td><td>2 claws/1 bite</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage:</strong></td><td>1d4/1d4/1d4+1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Attacks:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Defences:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong></td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lair Probability:</strong></td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intelligence:</strong></td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong></td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level/XP:</strong></td><td>4/175+4/hp</td></tr></tbody></table>

Dretch are the weakest of all demonkind. Their appearance is almost comical, with a plump body with thin, gangly arms and legs. Their squat heads are bald and they have a slobbering, stupid visage.

Dretch usually attack in hordes, using tooth and claw in blind abandon. They also have the following special abilities which they can use at will, one at a time: _darkness_ (5-ft radius), _scare_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _telekinesis_ (as the 5th level magic user spell, up to 50 lbs), or _gate_ (as the 9th level magic user spell) a class A demon (15% chance of success). In addition, once per day they can cause a _stinking cloud_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), and _teleport_ without fail (as the 5th level magic user spell, but with no chance of error).

_Treasure:_ Dretch are not intelligent enough to hoard treasure socially. Individually they will carry some coinage, as follows: 3d8 cp, 3d6 sp, 2d6 ep, and 2d4 gp.

**Ekivu (Fly Demon)**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency:</strong></td><td>Common</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. Encountered:</strong></td><td>1d3 or 1d6 (in the Abyss)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size:</strong></td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Move:</strong></td><td>50-ft; 210-ft flying (AA:III)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Armour Class:</strong></td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td>7+2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td><td>2 claws/1 bite</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage:</strong></td><td>2d4/2d4/1d4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Attacks:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Defences:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong></td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lair Probability:</strong></td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intelligence:</strong></td><td>Average</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong></td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level/XP:</strong></td><td>7/1,275 +10/hp</td></tr></tbody></table>

Ekivu resemble a hideous crossbreed between a giant fly and a human. Their hind legs are insect-like and their fore-limbs resemble human arms, but with bony, sharp claws. Like flies, their bodies are covered in blueish-black chitin with bristling hair. Their heads are vaguely human, but with bulbous, faceted eyes like those of a fly. Their mouths are ringed with sharp teeth and their long noses are actually a sharp proboscis for drawing blood from their victims.

Ekivu can cause _darkness_ within a 5-ft radius. They also have the following special abilities which they can use at will, one at a time: _detect good_ (as the 1st level cleric spell), _detect invisibility_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _telekinesis_ (as the 5th level magic user spell, up to 150 lbs), _fear_ (touch only, otherwise as the 4th level magic user spell) or _gate_ (as the 9th level magic user spell) another ekivu (15% chance of success).

When not using one of their other abilities, ekivu constantly make an insidious buzzing drone which has the power to lull listeners into a comatose state. If a save vs spells (unlisted categories) is not made, the victim will sleep for 2d4 hours or until the demon has drawn 1d4 hp of their blood.

Ekivu can be hit with normal weapons, although they are invulnerable to all forms of poison.

Ekivu have a long standing hatred of most other classes of demons, especially classes A and B. Ekivu have managed to enslave a number of shub, which they use for their own nefarious ends.

_Treasure:_ If encountered in their lair, they will possess a hoard of 1d8×1,000 cp (50%), 1d6×1,000 sp (25%), 1d4×1,000 ep (25%), 1d3×1000 gp (25%), 1d8 gems (30%), 1d4 jewellery (20%) and possibly a magical weapon (10%).

Those unfortunate souls who are damned to the Abyss become kullules; the demonic horde. The most evilly accursed among them are bound to spend eternity wandering the flaming tiers of Gehenna. They are only semi-intelligent, instinctively driven to blindly attack by tooth and nail any being not of demonkind. The GM should treat them as undead for purposes of _sleep_, _charm_ and other similar spells. Killing them is fruitless, as they collapse into a pile of ordure which reforms into a new kullule in a day. They are only truly destroyed when one of the demonlords chooses to feed on them.

Unlike other demons, the kullule have no ability to cause _darkness_ or similar demonic powers. They are invulnerable to normal melee and missile weapons however, and require a +1 or better magical weapon to hit.

Shadows and ghasts are often created from kullule by their demonic masters. The success or failure of this is largely dependent on how evil they were as living souls. Occasionally they are ordered by a greater demon lord to the Prime Material Plane, where they may remain for but a single day. These kullule are usually selected from amongst those in Gehenna.

_Treasure:_ None

**Quasit**

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency:</strong></td><td>Very rare</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. Encountered:</strong></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size:</strong></td><td>Small</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Move:</strong></td><td>150-ft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Armour Class:</strong></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td><td>2 claws/1 bite</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage:</strong></td><td>1d2/1d2/1d4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Attacks:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Defences:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong></td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lair Probability:</strong></td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intelligence:</strong></td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong></td><td>Chaotic evil</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level/XP:</strong></td><td>5/325 +3/hp</td></tr></tbody></table>

Quasit are soul worms formed by Demon Lords for service as familiars to chaotic evil clerics and magic users. At will, quasits are able to polymorph themselves into any 2 of the following creatures: frog, bat, giant centipede, or wolf.

Quasits are immune to normal melee and missile weapons. Only iron or +1 or better magical weapons can harm them. They are also immune to all cold, fire and lightning. If attacked with a spell, quasits save as a 7 hit dice monster.

In its natural form, a quasit attacks with its teeth and claws, which inflict a burning irritation that subtracts 1 from the victim's dexterity unless a save vs poison is made. This penalty is cumulative. The irritation remains for 2d6 melee rounds.

Quasits also have several abilities which they may use at will. These are _detect good_ (as the 1st level cleric spell), _detect magic_ (as the 1st level cleric spell), _invisibility_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), and they regenerate 1 hit point per melee round. Once per day, they can cause _fear_ (as the 4th level magic user spell) in a 30-ft radius.

When serving as a familiar, quasits endow their master with several abilities. If the master is within a mile of their quasit familiar, a constant full-sensory telepathic communication operates through the quasit. The master also gains 1 level of ability. If the quasit is within 25-ft of its master, it imparts its 25% magic resistance and also its regeneration abilities. If either master or quasit move out of range, the special abilities are lost. In addition to these abilities, once per week a quasit is able to contact the Abyss in order to help gain some necessary advice or information. This operates as the 5th level cleric spell _commune_, and up to 6 questions are permitted.

Despite their rather low intelligence, quasits are quite crafty and cunning creatures. They are also used as tools by demon lords, who might communicate through them. Quasits are generally tasked with helping their masters to spread evil and chaos. In particular, they are often used to pervert lawful evil souls to chaos, which earns them rewards on their home plane of the Abyss. Ultimately, when its master dies, the quasit is charged with bringing the soul back to the Abyss. If the quasit has served well, it may be rewarded by being changed into a class A or class B demon. If not, they will be punished through becoming a kullule, soul worm, or even a quasit again.

If the quasit dies, the master immediately loses 4 levels (duration 1 month).

_Treasure:_ None.

**Shub**

Shub resemble deformed humanoids, with hunchbacks, twisted arms and legs, and a strange, loping gait. Their pinhead skulls are bald, and their pointed ears flop down.

While physically among the weakest of demonkind, the shub are a vile, vengeful sort. They are the continual target of abuse by other classes of demon, and the shub are quick to respond in kind if given the opportunity. Shub particularly enjoy bullying the dretch, whom they despise as lumbering and stupid.

Shub have the following special abilities, which they can use at will, one at a time: cause _darkness_ (5-ft radius), _fear_ (touch only, otherwise as the 4th level magic user spell), _fly_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _telekinesis_ (as the 5th level magic user spell, up to 100 lbs), or _gate_ in an ekivu (15% chance of success). Once per day, shub can _teleport_ (without fail, otherwise as the 5th level magic user spell).

In combat, shub prefer to wield a variety of strange, wicked-looking pole arms, saw-toothed swords, and bizarre atlatls and throwing knives.

_Treasure:_ Shub love treasure, and will try to steal or swindle to get it. Most Shub will have some coins in a sack or pouch (2d12×10 ep, 2d4×5 gp). If encountered in their lair, Shub may have 1d4×1,000 cp (25%), 1d3×1,000 sp (20%) and 1d4 random gems (50%).

These solitary demons are always female. In their true form they look like stunningly beautiful, and naked, humanoid women with leathery bat wings sprouting from their back. They are immune to normal melee and missile weapons and a +1 or better magical weapon is needed to hit them. At will, they can cause _darkness_ (5-ft radius). They also are able to use the following abilities at will one at a time: become æthereal (as per the magic item _**oil of æthereality**_), _charm person_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _ESP_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _clairaudience_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _suggestion_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _polymorph self_ (humanoid shapes only, otherwise as the 4th level magic user spell), or _gate_ (as the 9th level magic user spell) a class D demon (70% chance)or a class E demon (30% chance) with a 4 in 10 chance of success.

Their most prominent ability is their kiss, which they inflict on their charmed or unconscious victims. Each kiss drains one level from the victim and they may kiss a particular victim but once a day. If they take a liking to a particular victim, a succubus may mate with a human male, producing a demonette (see listing for further details).

In the Abyss, the succubi reign over lesser demons through intimidation and trickery. They also prize treasure, especially gems and jewellery.

_Treasure:_ If encountered in their lair, a succubus will have 3d6×1,000 pp (30%), 2d10 gems (55%), 1d12 jewellery (50%) and perhaps a random magic item (15%).

**Uduk**

The uduk, or the 'jumping demon', looks much like an orang-utan with a horribly twisted face. Its hands and feet are taloned and have 6 digits each. The uduk can move on foot along the ground, but they excel at swinging through areas of dense foliage. They can also jump up to 40 feet in a single bound.

They have a natural ability to change their colouration to match their surroundings, which takes one melee round. They also possess standard infravision. Uduk are vulnerable to both normal and magical weapons.

In addition to the abilities they share with all demonkind, uduk have the following abilities, which they can use at will; cause _darkness_ (10-ft radius), _fear_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), _create water_ (as the 1st level cleric spell), _detect illusion_ (as the 1st level Illusionist spell), _detect invisibility_ (objects only, otherwise as the 2nd level magic user spell), _dispel magic_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _entangle_ (as the 1st level druid spell), _plant growth_ (as the 3rd level druid spell), _telekinesis_ (as the 5th level magic user spell, up to 250 lbs), or _gate_ in another uduk (25% chance of success). Twice per day they can also use change self (as the 1st level illusionist spell), invisibility (as the 2nd level magic user spell), and spectral force (as the 3rd level Illusionist spell).

Uduk do not like the company of other demons, and generally are found only with others of their ilk. If other kinds of demons are present, uduk will bully weaker demons in order to undermine their superiors.

_Treasure:_ If encountered in their lair, uduk will have a pile of treasure including 1d12×1,000 cp (20%), 1d6×1,000 sp (30%), 1d4×1,000 ep (10%), 1d6 gems (25%) and 1d3 jewellery (20%). In addition, they might (10%) have 1d2 random magical items.

## Devils

The primary inhabitants of the planes of Hell are the devils. They are the champions of lawful evil, and are the implacable foes of chaotic demonkind and all servants of good.

Devil society is organized into a strict hierarchy, which is never compromised for fear of retribution from the archdevils, who rule the planes of Hell. Nevertheless, squabbling and rivalries are common amongst devils. Amongst the archdevils themselves there also exists a hierarchy of barons, dukes, marquises, and princes—cause for considerable rivalry and jealousy.

All devils can move between the various planes of Hell, although this usually requires permission from the archdevil who rules the particular plane. Devils may also move at will to Gehenna, Hades, and Acheron. Similarly, they can also travel to the Astral Plane, but this is rare. Devils are not allowed to enter the other planes (e.g. the Prime Material) without a proper summoning, a _gate_ spell, or the invocation of their secret name (if they have one).

All devils possess special, magical abilities which may vary according to individual type. They can use these abilities at will one at a time. These abilities are: _animate dead_ (as the 5th level magic user spell), c_harm person_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _fear_ (effect varies, as the 4th level magic user spell), _know alignment_ (as the 2nd level cleric spell), _spectral_ _force_ (as the 3rd level illusionist spell), _suggestion_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _teleport_ (no chance of error, otherwise as the 5th level magic user spell), and summoning other devils (varies, as the 3rd level magic user spell _monster summoning I_.

All devils have infravision and may understand and communicate in any language.

Only the material form of a devil may be killed. To actually slay a devil one must do so in the planes of Hell or a neighbouring lower plane. If its material form is slain, a devil must return to its home plane in Hell for nine decades of servitude as a lemure before it will resume its former status.

Once combat is joined with devils, they can never be subdued. In dire circumstances the major devils and archdevils may be willing to negotiate. Lesser devils will madly fight to the death. If it is to their advantage, devils can split their attacks among 2 or more targets.

Devils are exceptionally conscious of any kind of laws or contracts binding them to certain behaviour, and are profoundly adept at exploiting hidden loopholes. Negotiating with them can be quite tedious as every minute detail and exigency must be properly accounted for.

Just as when summoning a demon, proper inscription of a magical circle of protection is necessary for the conjurer's safety when attempting to summon a devil. These circles are type-specific, with more powerful devils requiring proportionately more complex and expensive circles. Devils are also repulsed by good artifacts.

Devils are susceptible to attack as noted in the table below;

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Attack Form</strong></td><td><strong>Damage Rolled</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Acid</td><td>Full damage</td></tr><tr><td>Cold</td><td>Half damage</td></tr><tr><td>Electricity (lightning bolt)</td><td>Full damage</td></tr><tr><td>Fire (dragon breath, fireball)</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Gas, poisonous (cloudkill)</td><td>Half damage</td></tr><tr><td>Iron weapons</td><td>No additional damage</td></tr><tr><td>Magic missile</td><td>Full damage</td></tr><tr><td>Poison</td><td>Full damage</td></tr><tr><td>Silver</td><td>Full damage (according to normal weapon type)</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Assagim**

These are the lowest of all the devils, and they are found in the millions throughout every plane of Hell. Assagim are the unfortunate souls of those not evil enough to be incarnated as lemures. They are totally senseless—having neither eyes, ears, or mouth. They are telepathically sensitive to other devils, and can receive commands from most other types of devil except lemures.

Assagim resemble lumpy blobs of flesh with two crude arms ending in claws. In combat, they attack with their two sharp claws. If organized by an archdevil into an army, they are sometimes armed with crude clubs or maces which they use to blindly batter their opponents en masse. If slain in the service of evil, assagim will usually (99%) reincarnate within one day as another assagim. A small percentage (1%) become lemures; and within another 10 millennia, they might again be reincarnated as one of the lesser devils.

If injured in Hell or another adjacent plane, assagim will regenerate damage at a rate of 1 hit point per round. If injured due to a weapon or artifact of good, no regeneration is possible.

_Treasure:_ None

**Barbed Devil**

_(Lesser Devil; Hamatula, Barbicale)_

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Frequency:</strong></td><td>Uncommon</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No. Encountered:</strong></td><td>1d2 or 3d4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size:</strong></td><td>Man-sized</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Move:</strong></td><td>120-ft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Armour Class:</strong></td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hit Dice:</strong></td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attacks:</strong></td><td>2 claws/1 tail</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Damage:</strong></td><td>2d4/2d4/3d4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Attacks:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Special Defences:</strong></td><td>See below</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong></td><td>35%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lair Probability:</strong></td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Intelligence:</strong></td><td>Very</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Alignment:</strong></td><td>Lawful evil</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Level/XP:</strong></td><td>8/1,425 +10/hp</td></tr></tbody></table>

These devils are quite common on the 3rd and 4th planes of Hell. They are typically used as guards and sentries, a task which they excel at. Any trespassers will be quickly imprisoned in one of their many iron cells to await torture.

Barbed devils do not need any hand weapons. They are quite proficient at using their hard, sharply-barbed claws and tail to beat their victims into submission. Whenever they hit an opponent, they cause _fear_ (as the 4th level magic user spell).

Barbed devils have the following special abilities, which they can use one at a time, at will: _pyrotechnics_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _produce flame_ (as the 2nd level druid spell), _hold person_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), or _summon_ an additional barbed devil to their aid (30% chance of success).

_Treasure:_ Barbed devils do not carry treasure of any sort, nor can they be dissuaded from their tasks through bribery of any kind.

Bearded devils make their home on the 3rd plane of Hell. They are renowned for both their bloodthirstiness and their malicious cruelty. For this reason, they are often seen serving as shock troops in the legions of Hell.

Bearded devils have the following special abilities, which they can use one at a time, at will: _affect normal fires_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _command_ (as the 1st level cleric spell), f_ear_ (touch only, otherwise as the 4th level magic user spell), _produce flame_ (as the 2nd level druid spell), or _summon_ another bearded devil (35% chance of success).

In combat, bearded devils prefer to use a wickedly barbed and hooked glaive, which can entangle an opponent intent on escape (1d3 damage plus the victim pinned until Open Doors roll is successful). If unarmed, these devils will grab victims in their claws and use their bristly beards to scrape and burn. If they manage to hit with both claws, they will also score maximum damage with their beards (8 hp). Any victim struck for maximum damage from these “beard-burns” must make a save vs poison or be afflicted with a painful, itching rash (-1 dexterity every 4 rounds; duration 3d8 turns).

Bearded devils do not value treasure, although they may be influenced by offers of warm meat.

_Treasure:_ None

Bone devils make their lair on the 5th plane of Hell. They are cruel, and enjoy torturing those weaker than themselves. They resemble large skeletons, covered in leathery white flesh, with a segmented tail like a scorpion.

Unlike most devils, bone devils prefer the frigid climate of their home plane. They have ultravision (60-ft range) which is more suited to icy climates. In addition, bone devils have several special abilities which they can use one at a time, at will. These are _fear_ (5-ft radius, otherwise as the 4th level magic user spell), _phantasmal force_ (as the 1st level illusionist spell), _fly_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _invisibility_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _detect invisibility_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), or _summon_ another bone devil (40% chance of success). Once per day, they can create a _wall of ice_ (as the 4th level magic user spell).

Bone devils wield a large bone hook to snag their opponents. If they score a hit, there is a 50% chance the victim will be pinned. These devils then sting with their scorpion-like tails (2d4 damage, save vs poison or lose 1d4 strength for 10 rounds).

Bone devils carry no treasure. They cannot be bribed with coins or gems, but they consider frozen humanoid flesh a delicacy.

_Treasure:_ None.

Devilcats are a minor type of devil, often seen serving their infernal masters in the nine planes of Hell. Rarely, devilcats also travel to the Prime Material Plane to serve as a familiar for an important evil spell caster.

In normal lighting, devilcats are invisible. In total darkness however, they can be dimly seen as a glowing reddish aura resembling a large feline. Devilcats are immune to the effects of all _charm_, _sleep_, _hold_ and _suggestion_ spells. Further, they can only be harmed by magical weapons.

Devilcats encountered on the Prime Material Plane who are not already serving as a familiar may attach themselves to a suitable lawful evil character. They prefer to serve clerics, but will also attach themselves to a magic user or illusionist. If a stronger lawful evil character is present, devilcats will willingly switch to the new master, even betraying or attacking their former master in the process. In any case, a devilcat is only allowed to remain on the Prime Material Plane for a year and day. At the end of this period they must return to Hell. Sometimes they may later travel to the Prime Material Plane again, but will not necessarily seek out their old master.

_Treasure:_ None.

These winged humanoids usually appear female, although a few (10%) are male. Erinyes dwell on the 2nd Plane of Hell, and are tasked with retrieving evil souls from the Prime Material Plane for their diabolical masters.

In melee, erinyes use a magical dagger which is poisonous and causes horribly painful wounds (save vs poison or pass out for 1d6 rounds). These devils also carry ropes of entanglement, which they use to bind their prisoners.

Erinyes have several special abilities. They can use these at will, one at a time. They are _fear_ (gaze, otherwise as the 4th level magic user spell), _detect invisibility_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _locate object_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _invisibility_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _polymorph self_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), _produce flame_ (as the 2nd level druid spell), or _summon_ another erinyes to their aid (25% chance of success).

Erinyes are unrelenting pursuers and prefer to capture their victims alive and return them to Hell for punishment. On occasion, erinyes may be willing to bargain, but they are quite crafty and will always try to tempt the bargainer into committing a great sin.

_Treasure:_ If encountered in their hellish aeries, these devils may have a treasure hoard made up of 2d4×1,000 gp (40%), 1d6×10 pp (50%), 4d8 gems (55%) and 1d12 jewellery (45%).

Horned devils are inhabitants of the 6th and 7th planes of Hell. Although considered to be greater devils, they are weaker than either ice devils or pit fiends, whom they despise. Horned devils have their own personal names which can be used to summon and control them.

In combat, horned devils typically use either a barbed fork (75%, 2d6 damage) or a jagged whip (25%, 1d4 damage plus the victim is stunned 1d4 rounds—save vs spells for unlisted categories to avoid). If unarmed, these devils can attack with their sharp claws or a bite. Finally, they also can attack with their sharply-tipped tails which cause weeping wounds (1d3 damage plus 1 hp of damage per turn until the wound is bound or cured).

Horned devils constantly emanate _fear_ (as the 4th level magic user spell) in a 5-ft radius. These devils also have several special abilities, which they can use one at a time, at will: _ESP_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _detect magic_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _phantasmal force_ (as the 1st level illusionist spell), _pyrotechnics_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _produce flame_ (as the 2nd level druid spell) or _summon_ another horned devil (50% chance of success).

_Treasure:_ If a horned devil lair is found, it may contain a hoard of 3d6×100 pp (30%), 2d10 gems (55%), 1d12 jewellery (50%) and perhaps even a random magic item (15%).

Ice devils resemble upright remorhaz with humanoid arms and legs, and knotted, barbed tails. They dominate the 8th plane of Hell, which serves as their frozen home. They are also very strong (18.76 strength) and enjoy torturing their victims before killing them. Ice devils also have secret personal names which can be used to summon them, if the name is somehow known to the conjurer.

In combat, these devils will usually rely on their claws, mandibles, and tails. Occasionally (25%), they wield long, magical spears which they can use to impale and freeze their victims (2d6 damage plus the victim must save vs paralysation or be reduced to half their normal move).

Ice devils exude _fear_ (as the 4th level magic user spell) in a 10-ft radius. They also have infravision (60-ft) which is useful in their frigid lairs. If injured, they will regenerate 1 hp per round. In addition, ice devils have these special abilities which they can use one at a time, at will: _detect invisibility_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _detect magic_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _fly_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _polymorph self_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), _wall of ice_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), or _gate_ in 2 bone devils (70%) or another ice devil (30%) with a 60% chance of success in either case. Once per day, an ice devil can call forth an _ice storm_ (as the 4th level magic user spell).

_Treasure:_ If their lair is plundered, ice devils will have a buried cache containing 2d4×1,000 gp (40%), 1d6×10 pp (50%), 4d8 gems (55%) , and 1d12 jewellery (45%).

Imps are formed from soul worms, created by archdevils to spread evil through service to a lawful evil priest or sorcerer. They are very rarely encountered on the Prime Material Plane, but are commonly seen in the lower planes. They have only average intelligence, but in their role as familiars they are able to rely on the knowledge of their archdevil master.

Imps are created with the innate ability to polymorph self. The GM should choose two of the following forms (giant rat, goat, large spider, raven). In their polymorphed form, imps are limited to that animal's natural attacks. In their natural form, imps attack with their poison-tipped tail stingers. Any victim struck must save vs poison or die.

Imps are immune to normal melee and missile weapons. Only silver and +1 or better magical weapons can damage them. Imps are also immune to cold, fire, and electrical attacks. Imps also have several special abilities, which they can use in whatever form they are in, one at a time at will. These are: _detect good_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _detect magic_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), and _invisibility_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell). Once per day, an imp can cast a _suggestion_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell). Once per week it can _commune_ with the lower planes (6 questions maximum, otherwise as the 5th level cleric spell).

When serving as a familiar to an evil magic user or cleric, the Imp imparts the following benefits to its master: Constant full-sensory telepathic contact between the Imp and the master up to 1 mile in range. If the master is within 25-ft of the imp, the former gains the Imp's 25% magic resistance and its regeneration ability (1 hp/round). If the master is within 1 mile of the Imp, the former gains an additional level of ability. However, if the imp is killed, the master immediately loses four ability levels.

_Treasure:_ Imps normally possess no treasure of any kind. If encountered in their lair in the lower planes however, they might have a small hoard of 1d4×1,000 cp (25%) and 1d3×1,000 sp (20%).

Lemures are the primal form of evil souls damned to spend eternity in Hell. They are only vaguely humanoid, with crude arms and heads. Due to their ongoing torment, lemures are quite insane and will attack any non-devils coming close to them. Certain lemures (5%) are chosen by archdevils to form wraiths, spectres, and other æthereal undead.

Lemures cannot normally be destroyed, except by blessed or holy items or weapons. They regenerate 1 hit point per round. They are immune to all forms of _sleep_ or _charm_ spells.

_Treasure:_ None.

The manalishi, also known as “scaly devils” and “abyssai,” are quite common on the upper planes of Hell. Most manalishi serve the five-headed dragon queen of Hell.

Their appearance epitomizes the human idea of what a devil should look like. They are humanoid-shaped with horns, bat-like wings, and a long spiked tail. Their scaled hide varies, as there are five distinct breeds of manalishi: black, blue, green, red, and white.

In combat, manalishi generally wield specific weapons depending on their breed (see above). All manalishi can use their spiky tails as a weapon for 1d2 damage. They can also grapple, using their scaled and barbed skin to damage their victims. Damage is as follows: black 1d4+4, blue 1d4+3, green 1d4+2, red 1d4+1, white 1d4+2.

Manalishi have the following special abilities, which they can use one at a time at will: _change self_ (as the 1st level illusionist spell), _command_ (as the 1st level cleric spell), _produce flame_ (as the 2nd level druid spell), _pyrotechnics_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), or _scare_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell). Once per day, they can attempt to _summon_ another manalishi (20% chance of success).

_Treasure:_ If manalishi are encountered in one of their hellish lairs they will have no treasure cache, but they may (10%) have another 1d4 other breeds of manalishi with them. If encountered in transit however, they may (15%) have 1d4 large gems, which they are delivering to one of their devil masters.

These devils resemble humanoids with large, bulbous heads and small, evil features. Their wings are black with silver tips.

Shaitan dwell on the 5th plane of Hell, where they serve the archdevil, Geryon. Their primary task is to acquire souls for their master. Occasionally, they will travel to the Prime Material plane on a mission of murder and mayhem. Dispelling a shaitan on the Prime Material plane requires pronouncement of a holy word (the 7th level cleric spell).

In combat, these devils will attempt to touch their victim (2d4 damage) and thereby cast an imprisonment spell (as the 9th level magic user spell). Shaitans are immune to normal melee and missile weapons. Either silver or a +1 or better magical weapon is needed to hit them.

_Treasure:_ If encountered in their hellish lairs, shaitan are likely to have 2d4×1,000 gp (40% chance), 1d6×10 pp (50%), 4d8 gems (55%) and 1d12 jewellery (45%). Individual shaitan will sometimes be found carrying 1d4 gems (50% chance) as well.

Spiked devils are small and weak compared to the other devils, but are amongst the most commonly seen types. They have scaly reddish skin and bat-like wings. A row of dark spines runs from their forehead to the base of their tail. Both their hands and feet have sharp claws.

In melee, they usually attack with a trident, fork, or similar pole arm. When flying and attacking a target on the ground, they can also attack with their clawed feet.

Their spines are also an effective weapon, and burst into flame when plucked from the devil's back. If attacking from above, these devils can also shoot up to 12 of their spines (1d4 damage, like a dart). In melee, should they choose to grapple, 1d4 of the spines will damage the opponent. In any case, the spines should be considered as a flaming attack.

Spiked devils also have the following special abilities which they can use one at a time, at will: _affect normal fires_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _change self_ (as the 1st level illusionist spell), _command_ (as the 1st level cleric spell), _produce flame_ (as the 2nd level druid spell), and _scare_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell). Once per day they can attempt to _summon_ a barbed devil (5% chance of success).

Spiked devils are typically used for herding assagim or lemures, or serving as a messenger for more powerful devils.

_Treasure:_ These devils rarely have any sort of treasure or possessions beyond their weapon. Only when serving as a messenger are they likely to possess something of value. In these cases, the GM should decide what, if anything the spiked devil is carrying.

Pit fiends are native to the 9th Plane of Hell, and are the personal servants of Asmodeus, the Lord of Hell. They are both incredibly strong and diabolically evil. All pit fiends have secret personal names which can be used to summon them.

In combat, pit fiends wield a scimitar and a spiked club with equal proficiency. They can also strike with their serpentine tail, which causes 2d4 points of constriction damage per round, unless the victim makes a successful Open Doors roll.

Pit fiends exude _fear_ (as the 4th level magic user spell) in a 20-ft radius. These devils also have the following special abilities, which they can use one at a time, at will: detect invisibility (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _detect magic_ (as the 1st level magic user spell), _hold person_ (as the 3rd level magic user spell), _polymorph self_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), _produce flame_ (as the 2nd level druid spell), _pyrotechnics_ (as the 2nd level magic user spell), _wall of fire_ (as the 4th level magic user spell), or _summon_ 1d3 barbed devils (60%) or another pit fiend (70%). Once per day, a pit fiend can use a _symbol of pain_ (as the 7th level cleric spell).

_Treasure:_ If encountered in their nethermost lair, they are liable to have a hoard of 2d4×1,000 gp (40%), 10d6 pp (50%), 4d8 gems(55%), and 1d12 jewellery (45%). Individual pit fiends will typically carry only 3d8 copper pieces.

Soul worms are the remains of the most base and any evil souls who have been imprisoned in Hell for eternity. Their appearance is similar to a putrescent maggot with a leering humanoid face. They live in great squirming masses and are tended by night hags, who trade them to demons and devils for the creation of quasits and imps. Liches also make use of soul worms to help preserve their essence throughout the centuries.

_Treasure:_ None.

## Dinosaurs

In OSRIC the “dinosaur” category also includes other creatures contemporaneous with or predating the dinosaurs. This means that for the purposes of the OSRIC core rules, prehistoric creatures such as dimetrodon or plesiosaurus are included with “dinosaurs”, even though palaeontologists classify them separately.

These rules do include an indication of the rough period in which the dinosaur lived, but dinosaur-infested areas often resemble Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World in that a mishmash of dinosaurs from different times co-exist. Dinosaur areas are only really suitable for relatively high-level play. Portals to such areas can sometimes be found in the nethermost depths of large dungeons.

Tyrannosaurids and allosaurids are not related families, but they occupy the same ecological niche: large bipedal carnivores. Allosaurus and saurophaganax are allosaurids, the others are tyrannosaurids. The “Number Encountered” listing allows for two interpretations—they could be solitary predators or pack hunters.

_Tyrannosaurus:_ Cretaceous carnivore, long thought to be the largest land carnivore of the dinosaur age. _Gorgosaurus:_ cretaceous carnivore, smaller than tyrannosaurus. _Tarbosaurus:_ cretaceous carnivore, closely related to tyrannosaurus. _Albertosaurus:_ much smaller cretaceous carnivore. _Allosaurus:_ Jurassic carnivore. _Saurophaganax:_ Jurassic carnivore, may be just a very large allosaurus.

Herbivores who foraged on all fours and ran on hind legs, there are two main families of the duck-billed dinosaurs known as hadrosaurids: hadrosaurines and lambeosaurines. In game terms there is no difference. Some could be interpreted as Semi-amphibious swamp or wetland dwellers, in which case they should have a swimming move, but many, perhaps all, are fully terrestrial. Trachodon and Anatosaurs are now-superseded names for kinds of hadrosaurid.

_Edmontosaurus:_ Cretaceous herbivore, formerly “anatosaurus”. _Charonosaurus:_ Cretaceous herbivore. Shantungosaurus: Cretaceous herbivore. _Saurolophus:_ Cretaceous herbivore. _Hypacrosaurus:_ Cretaceous herbivore. _Telmatosaurus:_ Smaller cretaceous herbivore.

Large quadrupedal herbivores with elephantine bodies and extremely longnecks and tails, the sauropods are herd animals. They can bite, but are only really dangerous when they trample. Trampling automatically kills any creature weighing less than a ton in their path—saving throw vs death to avoid. A whole herd stampeding is an impressive sight, best viewed from a safe distance. In fantasy gaming environments sauropods might make good meat animals or beasts of burden.

_Apatosaurus:_ Jurassic herbivore, once called _brontosaurus_. _Diplodocus:_ Jurassic herbivore, famously long. _Brachiosaurus:_ Jurassic herbivore; long thought to be the largest land dinosaur. _Argentinosaurus:_ Cretaceous herbivore, relatively recently discovered, twice as massive as _b__rachiosaurus_. _Camarasaurus:_ Very common Jurassic herbivore. _Cetiosaurus:_ Jurassic herbivore, earlier relative of the other types.

Ceratopsians are quadrupedal beasts with horns and bony head armour. They fill the rhinoceros' ecological niche. Ceratopsians are bad-tempered and prone to charge, making them among the most dangerous of the dinosaur herbivorous species. They were extremely common during the late cretaceous period. The best known and most common of these creatures, triceratops, was probably about twice as heavy as an elephant. Ceratopsians have two AC scores: one for their armoured heads, the other for their bodies.

If a ceratopsian exceeds its required “to hit” roll by 4 or more, it has knocked down its target and will stomp on it for the listed extra damage.

_Pentaceratops:_ Cretaceous herbivore, resembling a triceratops with a longer neck-frill and two extra horns protruding from under its eyes. _Triceratops:_ Cretaceous herbivore. Unlike most other ceratopsians it does not seem to have lived in herds. _Diceratops:_ Cretaceous herbivore; extremely rare compared to triceratops. _Styracosaurus:_ Cretaceous herbivore with a distinctive spiky neck-frill; about half the size of triceratops. _Monoclonius:_ Cretaceous herbivore with only one horn. _Centrosaurus:_ Cretaceous herbivore that seems to have lived in very large herds.

_Treasure:_ None (for all ceratopsians).

Dimetrodon is technically a synapsid, and is anachronistic here by quite a large number of millions of years, being more separated from Tyrannosaurus in time than 21st century humans are. It had a huge “sail” on its back that may have helped it regulate its temperature. GMs who are fans of Jurassic Park should note the Dilophosaurus presented there was a result of quite a lot of artistic license.

_Compsognathus:_ Jurassic carnivore. _Deinonychus:_ Cretaceous carnivore. _Dimetrodon:_ Permian carnivore. _Euparkeria:_ Triassic carnivore. _Ornitholestes:_ Jurassic carnivore. _Dilophosaurus:_ Jurassic carnivore.

None of these creatures are technically dinosaurs, though all are found in “Lost World” areas. Dunkleosteus can swallow prey whole on a roll of “20” “to hit” (see “Fish, Giant: Gar”) and actually preceded the dinosaurs by many millions of years. Elasmosaurus can also swallow whole, needing only 18-20 on its “to hit” roll to do so but otherwise as dunkleosteus. Mosasaurus filled the same ecological niche as sharks. Plesiosaurs may have preferred smaller prey than a man but would still be dangerous. Nothosaurs were amphibious, like huge seals, and could move on land at 60-ft. Archelon was a kind of gigantic turtle.

_Dunkleosteus:_ Formerly known as _d__inichthys_; Devonian carnivore. _Elasmosaurus:_ Cretaceous carnivore. _Mosasaurus:_ Cretaceous carnivore. _Plesiosaurus:_ Jurassic carnivore. _Nothosaurus:_ Triassic carnivore. _Archelon:_ Cretaceous carnivore.

## Golems

A golem is a magically created monster. Of the four basic types, three are created with earthen materials, while the flesh golem is created from human body parts. The creation process requires powerful spells, rare components, and eldritch forces.

The golems listed below are typically humanoid in shape with size listed separately.

A golem has hit dice equal to its hit points divided by 4.5 rounded up; thus, for example, a stone golem has 14 hit dice (60 hp/4.5).

Magical creatures may strike a golem with effect if the creature's hit dice equal or exceed that of the golem.

**Clay Golem:** A clay golem is created through the following procedure: a lawful good cleric of at least 17th level (or a lower level cleric of same alignment using a magical tome written for such a process) creates a man-shaped figure out of clay and then undertakes an uninterrupted ritual involv- ing material components worth no less than 20,000 gp, vestments and ritual items worth another 30,000 gp and the spells resurrection, animate object, commune, prayer and bless.

Damage inflicted by a clay golem can only be healed by a cleric of 17th level or greater. It attacks as a 12 hit dice monster. Once per day, a clay golem can act as if hasted for three combat rounds after having been in melee for one round.

A clay golem is under the direct command of its creator. It stands a 1% cumulative chance of possession by a spirit of chaotic evil alignment for each round the golem is in combat. The creator can never regain control if the golem is possessed. Once possessed, the golem will kill any nearby living thing starting with the closest creature and will haste itself if it has not already done so.

**Flesh Golem:** A flesh golem follows simple commands by its creator, and can be ordered to stop all activity until a specific event takes place. For each melee round spent in combat, the flesh golem stands a 1% cumulative chance of going berserk and attacking all targets in sight. The golem's creator can attempt to reassert control at a chance of 10% per round.

A flesh golem is extremely strong and can break down doors and other wooden structures. It cannot be damaged with normal weapons; magical weapons damage normally.

Most spells have no effect on the monsters; cold and fire based spells will slow the golem to 50% speed for 2d6 combat rounds, while electrical attacks restore previous damage dealt to the golem at a rate of 1 hit point per die of damage inflicted by the spell (example: an 8 hit dice _lightning bolt_ will restore 8 hit points of damage).

A flesh golem is created with a magical tome written for such a process or by a magic user (of at least 14th level) using the following spells: _wish_, _polymorph object_, _geas_, _strength_, and _protection from normal missiles_. One thousand gold pieces per hit point of the golem is spent on material components, and the entire creation process takes one month.

**Iron Golem:** An iron golem is created through use of a magical tome or by an 18th level or higher magic user using the following spells: _cloud kill_, _wish_, _geas_, and _polymorph object_. Creation time is three months and material cost is 1,000 gp per hit point of the golem. The magic user can control his or her creation through simple commands. The golem can also be ordered to suspend movement until a particular condition is met (e.g. a door is opened, someone enters the room, etc.).

An iron golem is three times as strong as a flesh golem. In addition to its normal damage, once every 7 combat rounds an iron golem may breathe poison gas directly before it in a cloud of 10 cubic-ft.

Only magical weapons of +3 or greater in nature can deal damage to an iron golem. Only electrical magical attacks can affect it; such spells will slow the golem to one-half speed for 3 combat rounds. Fire attacks repair damage to the golem at a rate of one hit point per die of spell damage (i.e.: a 6 hit die _fireball_ will repair 6 hp of damage).

**Stone Golem:** A stone golem is created through use of a magical text or by a 16th or higher level magic user using the following spells: _geas_, _slow_, _wish_ and _polymorph object_. Creation time is two months and cost is 1,000 gp per hit point of the golem.

The magic user can control his or her creation through simple commands. The golem can also be ordered to suspend movement until a particular condition is met. A stone golem can cast a _slow_ spell every other melee round on all opponents within 10-ft of its front.

Only magical weapons of +2 or greater bonus can harm a stone golem. Such a golem is also invulnerable to most magic, the only exceptions being _rock to mud_ which halves the golem's attack and movement speed for 2d6 rounds, stone to flesh which makes it susceptible to normal weapons for one round, and _mud to rock_ which acts as a _heal_ spell on the monster.

_Treasure:_ None (for all golems).

## Lycanthropes

A lycanthrope is a human with the ability to change his or her shape to some animal form during the night hours. A full moon is 90% likely to trigger the transition to animal form automatically. Any humanoid bitten by a lycanthrope and damaged for 50% or more of its total hp who survives will contract the lycanthropic disease of its attacker. A _cure disease_ from a cleric of 12th level or higher will remove the disease if performed within three days of the attack. If the victim ingests belladonna within one hour after the attack there is a 25% chance the disease will be cured. However, swallowing belladonna in such a manner will incapacitate the victim for 1d4 days; there is also a 1% chance of the herb killing the victim.

A lycanthrope's “size” stat shows its shape-changed size. In human form they are obviously always Man-sized.

Each type of lycanthrope has its own language. The five most common types are listed below.

**Werebear:** A werebear appears in human form as a large hairy human with a solitary disposition. In ursine form, he or she is 50% likely to be accompanied by 1d6 brown bears. A werebear may summon 1d6 brown bears in 2d6 turns if they are within one mile. Werebears are immune to disease and heal three times faster than normal. They can also _cure disease_ in another creature within 1d4 weeks.

_Treasure:_ 2d4×1,000 gp (40%), 1d6×100 pp (50%), 4d8 gems (55%), 1d12 jewellery (50%), 1d4 scrolls+1 misc. magic+1 potion (60%)

**Wereboar:** A wereboar has a foul tempered disposition in either form and will attack in a frenzy. It is found in heavily woodedareas, butrarelywithnormalboars(15% chanceof 1d4 boars that will attack on direction by the lycanthrope).

_Treasure:_ 1d8×1,000 cp (50%), 1d6×1,000 sp (25%), 1d4×1,000 ep (25%), 1d3×1,000 gp (25%), 1d8 gems (30%), 1d4 jewellery (20%), sword, armour, or misc. wpn +2d4 potions (40%)

**Wererat:** The horrid ratmen infest the underground sewers and catacombs under large cities. They are stealthy and surprise on a 1-4. They can assume any of three forms: human, giant rat, or man-rat. In human or man-rat form, they often arm themselves with swords, but prefer to lure unsuspecting individuals into traps where the victim may be held for ransom or later meals. A wererat may summon 2d6 giant rats and control them. Rumours persist of a city of black wererats on a remote shore; the more fanciful tales suggest the black wererats may have powerful spell casters among their number who can magically affect the phases of the moon.

_Treasure:_ 1d12×1,000 cp (20%), 1d6×1,000 sp (30%), 1d4×1,000 ep (10%), 1d6 gems (25%), 1d3 jewellery (25%), any 2 magic items (10%)

**Weretiger:** Most weretigers are female and live much like a normal tiger does, though associating with the normal breed only 5% of the time. They can rake with their rear claws like a normal tiger. All normal cats are 75% likely to be friendly to a weretiger due to the lycanthrope's ability to speak with them.

_Treasure:_ 1d8×1,000 cp (10%), 1d12×1,000 sp (15%), 1d8×1,000 ep (15%), 1d6×1,000 gp (50%), 2d6 gems (50%), 1d6 jewellery (25%), any 2 magic item+1 potion (15%)

**Werewolf:** A werewolf may be of either sex and of any build. When in wolf form, the lycanthrope tends to walk on its back legs. If a werewolf pack numbers 5 to 8, then it will be a family pack which consists of a male, a female and 3-6 younger werewolves ranging from 60% to 90% mature.

When in its pack, the male will fight at +2 and deal full damage if the female has been attacked. The female will attack with a +3 bonus “to hit” and will do full damage if her cubs are threatened. The cubs will attack with a penalty of -4 to -1 depending on their stage of maturity and deal 1d4+1 hp per attack. Any pack may also include wolfweres (wolves who can assume human form).

_Treasure:_ 1d8×1,000 cp (50%), 1d6×1,000 sp (25%), 1d4×1,000 ep (25%), 1d3×1,000 gp (25%), 1d8 gems (30%), 1d4 jewellery (20%), sword, armour, or misc. weapon (10%)

## Sylvan or Faerie Creatures

Sylvan or faerie creatures are encountered in magical woodlands. Some may share territory with elves. As a group they are reclusive and(with some notable exceptions) good aligned. Their homes are typically places of extreme beauty with verdant, lush growth, profuse flowers, sparking waterfalls and limpid pools. Since these creatures tend to be highly magical with a mischievous sense of humour, encounters with them are often enormous fun—for the GM.

Found in sylvan woodland, often along with fauns, unicorns and similar creatures, brownies are shy and retiring. They can sometimes be persuaded to help good aligned creatures. They are skilled craftsmen, adept at making and repairing ordinary things, and highly magical; they may use the following spells once each per day: _confusion_, _continual light_, _dancing lights_, _dimension door_, _mending_, _mirror image_, _protection from evil_, and _ventriloquism_. They may become invisible at will, provided they remain still while doing so. They are also lucky and strongly defended against magic, which means they make all saving throws as a 7th level cleric does.

Thanks to their excellent senses and habitual alertness Brownies cannot be surprised. They speak their own tongue, elven, halfing, and can communicate with other fey creatures such as spites, nymphs or dryads.

_Treasure:_ 1d8×1,000 cp (5%), 1d12×1,000 sp (25%), 1d6×1,000 ep (20%), 1d10×1,000 gp (30%), 1d12 gems (20%), 1d8 jewellery (5%), any 2 magic items plus one potion and one scroll (15%)

Centaurs are part man, part horse. They have the body of a horse, but have the upper torso, arms and head of a human in place of the horse's neck and head. Antipathetic toward humans, yet friendly toward elves and their kin, centaurs prefer unfrequented glades, pastures and woodlands. An encountered coterie will be armed with: 50% hardwood clubs (2d4 damage), 25% composite and/or longbows with the remaining centaurs armed with lance and shield (thus, AC 4)—this last group being the leaders. All centaurs are capable of attacking with melee weapons and two hoof attacks each melee round.

If upon rare occasion encountered in their lush woodland lair, there will be an additional 1d6 (total 5d6 encountered) fighting centaurs, with twice that many females and 5d6 young. Non-fighting (female and elderly) centaurs possess but 3 hit dice and young only 1d3 hit points. The non-fighters and young attack only if directly threatened, and with hoof attacks only. Should the non-fighting and young centaurs be seriously threatened, there is a 90% chance they will be ransomed generously.

_Treasure:_ Individuals-2d4 gp (90%), 1d4 gems (50%); Lair-1d8×1,000 cp (10%), 1d12×1,000 sp (15%), 1d8×1,000 ep (15%), 1d6×1,000 gp (50%), 3d6×100 pp (30%), 2d10 gems (55%), 1d12 jewellery (50%), 2 magic items (15%), 1d4 magic scrolls and 1 magic potion (50%).

Dryads are bashful tree sprites who dwell in the most remote locations. They appear as stunning young maidens. They are never far from the oak tree of which they are a part. Dryads are non-violent and will never attack unless they have no other choice. A dryad will try to escape by stepping into any nearby tree. They can also cast _dimension door_ and return to their own tree. The only thing different about a tree that houses a dryad is its size. A dryad can also cast a _charm person_ spell thrice a day.

If a dryad sees a young man with a charisma score of at least 16 she will attempt to charm him. If successful there is a 50% chance he will never been again. If the youth does return it will be at least 1d4 years later.

Dryads have their own language as well as elven, pixie, sprite, and they can also speak with animals.

_Treasure:_ 2d4×100 gp (100%), 10d4 gems (50%)

Fauns live in remote forests or meadows far away from civilisation. They are a frisky race occupying most of their time with playing, flirting, and drinking. Fauns value their privacy and will try to drive away any intruders from their domain. They have been known to ignore intruders from time to time if given enough premium food and or wine.

A faun's primary defence is its magic pipes that only it can play. With it the faun can cast _charm_, _sleep_, or _fear_. All spells have a 60-ft radius and those within range must save vs magic or suffer the effects. Fauns will not attack physically unless they themselves are threatened. Their primary weapon is their horns. Sometimes (20%) they will be carrying a magic weapon.

Being nature spirits, fauns are very tuned into their surroundings and are surprised only on a roll of 1. Likewise fauns are experts with camouflage and can become 90% invisible when hiding in foliage.

Fauns can speak their own language as well as elven and common. It is also likely that fauns can understand the language of centaurs if any live nearby.

The lower body of a faun is covered with coarse fur that ranges from medium brown to dark brown. The upper half appears to be a deeply tanned human. A faun's horns and hooves are coloured a deep black.

Leprechauns are a magical race that love to torment those they encounter with practical jokes, general mischief, and swindles. They normally live in green fields or rolling hills on the outskirts of civilisation. A leprechaun can turn invisible, polymorph inanimate objects, make illusions, and perform ventriloquism at will. Because of their sharp senses they are never surprised.

One of the leprechaun's favourite tricks is to grab some valuable object, turn invisible and flee with it. If they are chased too closely they will drop the item rather then be tracked back to their lair. If they are caught or tracked back to their lair, the leprechaun will do or say just about anything to win their freedom back. Be warned, leprechauns are magical and they take great pride in their confidence games. Nothing they say should be considered the truth. A leprechaun will always be playing some kind of scam.

Treasure: 1d20×1,000 sp (10%), 1d12×1,000 ep (15%), 1d8×1,000 gp (40%), 1d8×100 pp (35%), 3d10 gems (20%), 1d10 jewellery (10%), 3 magic items (no sword or misc. weapon), 1 potion, 1 scroll (30%)

Nixies are fey creatures related to sprites that make their home in freshwater lakes. They appear as strangely beautiful humanoids with lightly scaled greenish skin and webbed hands and feet. Their eyes are silver and their hair is dark green, and they clad themselves in garments of seaweed. Nixies speak their own language and the common tongue. They also appear to be able to communicate, at least on a rudimentary level, with freshwater fish of all types.

Being fey, nixies take great delight in enslaving humans. If a human or demi-human approaches within 30 ft of a group of nixies they will attempt to charm him or her with a special group charm spell. This charm requires a minimum of 10 nixies to join hands and chant, and any person hearing this fey chanting must save vs spells at -2 or enter the water to serve the nixies as slave and paramour for a period of a year and a day. It should be noted a side effect of this variant charm grants the ability to breathe water for the duration of the spell. There is a brief opportunity to break the charm; if a dispel magic is cast upon the enthralled person before they enter the water there is a 75% the spell will be broken but once the victim has begun breathing water the chances of breaking the charm drop to only 10%.

Nixies are weak in combat but make up for this weakness by attacking en masse and overwhelming their enemies. They favour fighting with long daggers and long darts which, due to the nixies short stature, function as spears in their hands. Nixies will melee with these spears underwater and above water they will hurl them like missiles then melee with their daggers.

Nixies fear bright light and fire, their aquatic nature makes these things foreign to them and a strong presentation of either will drive them away. A strong light source presented underwater will be obscured by schools of nixie summoned fish surrounding the spell effect. Being fey, nixies have a natural magic resistance of 25% and, besides their special charm effect, they can also cast a water breathing spell with a duration of 24 hours once per day.

Nixies lair at the bottom of lakes, where they weave living seaweed into dwellings. These dwellings blend in with the underwater growth so well they are 90% unlikely to be noted until within 20 ft of them. These underwater villages are guarded by either 1d4 giant gar (25%) or 2d4 giant pike (75%) which will obey commands from the nixies (see: Fish, Giant). The nixies can also summon 20d4 small fish to obstruct both an invader’s vision and movement by massing upon them. Nixies can venture onto dry land but do so only with great reluctance.

_Treasure:_ Carried: magic dagger or javelin, 10%. Lair: 1d10×1,000 cp (25%), 1d6×1,000 sp (25%), 1d6×1,000 ep (15%), 1d2×1,000 gp (5%), 4d6 gems (45%), 2d4 jewellery (30%), 2 random scrolls (10%).

Nymphs are feminine nature spirits of almost indescribable beauty; it is said that even the mere glimpse of one is enough to rob a man of his sight or perhaps kill him. They typically inhabit natural places of particular loveliness, such as high mountain lakes or deep forest glades. Those who have attempted to relate what they saw speak of absolute perfection. Nymphs typically speak common in addition to their own enchanting language and reputedly have voices like honeyed nectar.

If attacked, nymphs will almost always attempt to flee, often by means of dimension door, which they are able to use once every day. Nymphs are also able to employ magic as though they were 7th level druids. Any character that chances to look upon a clothed nymph must make a saving throw vs spells or be permanently blinded; should a nymph be seen unclothed, then the consequence of a failed saving throw is death. Should a nymph deign to bestow a kiss upon a male, he will forget his troubles and pain for the remainder of the day.

Nymphs abhor evil and will occasionally aid someone in distress. Moreover, there is a small chance that a nymph will be favourably inclined towards a good aligned character who actively seeks her out, as long as he does not look upon her first; in the case of good-aligned human males with exceptional charisma, the chance of her favour is very high, but a saving throw is still required if he should happen to look upon her.

A lock of nymph's hair woven into a cloak or other item of clothing will magically increase the charisma of those who wear it by one point. Alternatively, the lock of hair may be used to create a powerful _**potion of sleep**_. Nymph tears are sometimes used in the creation of a _**philtre of love**_ and any woman (female demi-humans included) who bathes in a nymph's pool will have her charisma increased by two points until sundown.

_Treasure:_ 4d10 gems, 1d3 potions (75%).

Pixies are a race of troublesome creatures who enjoy playing tricks and generally annoying anyone who passes through their territory. They like to dwell in secluded forests. They are normally invisible and can stay invisible even when they attack. Unless the pixie turns visible, or they are otherwise detected, opponents roll “to hit” at -4.

Even though pixies are small, only about 32 in tall, they can defend themselves. Their swords are considered daggers. Their bows shoot three different kinds of arrows at +4 to hit. The first type of arrow is a standard type that causes 1d4+1 points of damage. The second type of arrow causes _sleep_ for 1d6 hours unless the target saves vs magic. The third type of arrow causes total amnesia if the target fails their save vs magic. The only way to regain memory is to receive an exorcism.

Pixies can make themselves visible or polymorph themselves. They are also able to create illusions with both sight and sound that do not have to be controlled. The illusion will last until it is touched or dispelled. A pixie's touch causes confusion in anyone who fails their save vs magic. The confusion will last until they receive a _remove curse_. Once each day pixies can cast _dispel magic_ (as if they were 8th level), _dancing lights_, and _ESP_. Some can also cast _irresistible dance_.

Pixies speak their own language, sprite, and common.

_Treasure:_ 2d4×1,000 gp (40%), 1d6×1,000 pp (50%), 4d8 gems (55%), 1d12 jewellery (45%), 2d4 potions (40%), 1d4 scrolls (50%), 1 misc. magic (60%)

Quicklings once resembled brownies, sylphs, pixies and other fey creatures, but have become corrupted by chaos. They dwell in fey areas, but the sylvan beauty of their homes has lost its subtlety and become sick, with plants forced to grow blooms of unnatural size and lurid colour, and their delicate scents have become cloying, eye-watering perfume.

Quicklings are somehow sped up in time, living at a different pace relative to other creatures of the prime material plane. They move so fast they can only be seen as a blur. Their three attacks (with daggers) constitute three separate attack routines, and the quickling will always win ini- tiative against any opponent who is not hasted. Quicklings cannot be surprised, and thanks to their enchanted nature and uncanny speed, they make all saving throws at +10 on the dice.

Each quickling can use the following spell-like powers once each per day: _dig_, _fire charm_, _forget_, _invisibility_, _levitate_, _shatter_ and _ventriloquism_.

Each group of quicklings will be led by one with 4d6 hp (treat as a 3HD monster). If there are more than a dozen quicklings, there will be two such quicklings plus one with 6d6 hp (treat as a 4HD monster). These leader-type quicklings will have daggers poisoned with a powerful _sleep_ toxin; anyone hit by their daggers must save vs poison or fall into a drugged slumber for 1d6 hours.

Quicklings speak most fey tongues, including elven, though they speak at three times normal speed which makes them very hard to understand.

Sprites use daggers in melee, but prefer small bows (treat as a short bow, but half range and 1d3 damage per arrow). The arrows will be coated with _sleep_ poison (save vs poison or slumber for 1d6 hours). They can become invisible at will, _detect evil_ at will as per the spell, and move in complete silence.

They will typically only attack evil creatures or those that blunder through their homes. Evil things will be slain, others removed in their sleep to somewhere far away.

Sylphs are aerial creatures thought to be closely related to nymphs. She spends most of her time fluttering around. Because a sylph's territory is so vast it is unlikely they will be encountered anywhere near their lair.

Sylphs are able to cast spells as if they are a 7th level magic user (4—1st level, 3—2nd level, 2—3rd level, 1—4th level). They also have the ability to cast _invisibility_ at will and conjure air elemental once per week.

Sylphs have their own language and can also understand common.

Treants are woodland creatures, reclusive to humankind but friendly with other good-aligned creatures of the woods. They resemble humanoid trees: their “arms” and “legs” are not easily seen as such until they begin moving. Treants are vigilant guardians of the woods, despising anyone of evil alignment and all who make reckless use of fire, regardless of alignment. Treants can animate 1d2 trees to aid them (see “Tree, Animated”) within a range of 180-ft. Separate experience is not awarded for killing such animated trees. Treants are quite vulnerable to fire: fire attacks requiring a roll “to hit” gain a bonus of +4, a treant makes saving throws vs fire at -4, and any hit die of damage inflicted upon a treant gains a +1 to its result. Damage inflicted by a treant's clubbing fists is determined as follows:

7-8 HD: 2d8 damage per fist 9-10 HD: 3d6 damage per fist 11-12 HD: 4d6 damage per fist

Unicorns avoid contact with all but woodland creatures, although they may render assistance to maidens who are pure of heart, allowing themselves to be tamed as steeds. Unicorns normally charge into battle, attacking only with their horns but for double damage on the initial attack. A unicorn's horn negates the effect of poison, with normally the merest touch being required.

_Treasure:_ 20d4 gems (50%); 1 miscellaneous magic item and 1 potion (60%)

## Undead

Undead share the following characteristics: They never check morale and are immune to _fear_ (except that clerics and paladins may cause a _fear_\-like effect by turning them, see Chapter 3); they are immune to _sleep_, _charm_ and _hold_\-type effects except for any such effects that are specific to undead (for example, if the GM chooses to house-rule a magic item or spell which has the effect hold undead, this would work); they suffer 2d4 damage from vials of holy water; and if damaged—for “injured” is the wrong word—they do not automatically heal, though certain undead types such as ghouls may be able to recover hit points by consuming living flesh and others such as spectres may do so through leeching a living creature's vital force (draining a level).

The legendary banshee is the ghost of an evil elven female. The spirit is found in remote countrysides and other lonely natural places. The groaning spirit can chill with a touch for 1d8 hp damage. It can also wail which will force all creatures within 30-ft to save vs magic or die. The mere sight of a banshee will cause fear unless the viewer saves vs spells. The banshee can _wail_ once per day and only during the dark hours. They cannot be affected by _sleep_, _charm_ or _hold_ spells, and are resistant to cold or electrical attacks. An _exorcism_ spell will slay the creature.

A coffer corpse resembles a zombie, seeming nothing more then a rotting, fetid corpse. They are the bodies of the dead who are left behind, never given a proper burial, their souls never finding rest.

Normal weapons do no damage to a coffer corpse. If they are hit for 6 or more points in a single round of combat by a normal weapon they will fall down, only to rise up the next round. All who witness this horror must save vs fear, those who fail will panic and run away. A magic weapon is needed to truly damage a coffer corpse. They are also immune to _sleep_ and _charm_ spells.

About 25% of the time a coffer corpse will attack with a weapon, all of the others will attack with their hands. If their attack is bare handed and they have successfully hit, they have grabbed their target by the throat causing 1d6 damage. Each successive round thereafter they cause an additional 1d6 damage as they are strangling their victim, with no additional roll needed. They will continue choking until they are destroyed or their victim is dead.

_Treasure:_ 1d8×1,000 cp (50%), 1d6×1,000 sp (25%), 1d4×1,000 ep (25%), 1d3×1,000 gp (25%), 1d8 gems (30%), 1d4 jewellery (20%), sword, armour, or misc. weapon (10%)

These terrible creatures are more powerful versions of ghouls, and are indistinguishable from them save their terrible stench, released when engaged in melee, that requires a save vs poison to avoid a terrible retching and -2 to all actions, including hit and damage. They can ignore protection from evil unless it is combined with certain pure non-alloyed metals.

Ghasts share the same spell immunities that ghouls do, and can travel the dream-realms as well, except in addition to using them to traverse the prime material, they can also enter the lower planes.

Certain entities of the higher hells use ghasts as slaves.

Ghosts are the spiritual remains of extremely evil humans who have been denied the ordinarily inexorable movement of their souls to the outer planes of existence after discarding their mortal shell. This sundering of their metaphysical essence creates a foul thing, roaming dark and desolate places, existing in both the æthereal plane and the prime material, seeking to slake a thirst that can never be sated. This exigent need for living essences is what drives these spirits into contact with mortals.

Merely beholding the awfulness of the ghost requires a saving throw vs magic. Failure causes the viewer to flee in panic (for 2d8 turns) and initiates a weaker form of the ghost's wither attack—which ages the victim 3d6 years as the ghost feasts on the life of the victim.

Clerics level 7 or greater can ignore this effect, as they have a better understanding of how to ward off such metaphysical forces, while other intelligences with 9 or more hit dice or levels gain a +3 to their saves.

Until the ghost manifests itself physically, it is immune to all attacks, spell or no, unless the attacker has a method to become æthereal. Even if the spell caster is in this state, ghosts are still immune to many forms of spells, though no sage has recorded what those magics might be. Magical weapons used in an æthereal state against a ghost typically have to strike against AC 7 or 8.

As if these terrible powers were not enough, any creature within 180-ft is threatened by the being's _magic jar_ ability, as per the spell. If this fails, then the ghost will manifest itself, taking on an ectoplasmic quality. Specially forged “pure” metals, especially silver, can cause half-damage to a ghost while it is manifested in this fashion, and magic weapons can affect it normally—in either case the attacker must hit AC 0. Spells still cannot affect it in this state unless the caster is æthereal. The manifest state allows the ghost to strike victims physically, with the full power of their withering attack—causing the victim to age 7d6 years per successful attack, no save possible. Victims who exceed their allotted lifespan are forever dead, with only a wish capable of reversing this end.

Treasure: 1d10×1,000 cp (5%); 2d6×1,000 sp (30%); 1d6×1,000 ep (25%); 2d4×1,000 gp (25%); 2d6 gems (15%); 1d6 jewellery (20%); 1d3-1 scrolls (30%); 1d8 potions (40%); 1d4-1 any other magic items (25%)

Ghouls are humans, who feasting on corpses and engaging in other vileness, have become undead, or in turn were killed by another ghoul without their corpses being sanctified by a cleric. Loping through the darkness with their vague canine cast and long black marrow-licking tongues, they haunt graves and ruins, seeking the flesh of the dead and the living. Though their minds are warped by the transformation, and their general intellect stunted, they still retain a terrible cunning, and they attack in fearless packs to good effect, bringing down the living to feast on their remains. Any human or demi-human, save elves, attacked by a ghoul must make a saving throw or be paralysed for 3d4 turns.

_Protection from evil_ will keep these things at bay, unless one so protected violates the circle by attacking the ghouls.

Ghouls are also said to be able travel the lands of dreams, using them as conduit to enter the waking world of men at various graveyards, and escaping without a trace. Marine ghouls are called “lacedons” and are sometimes found on ghost ships or dwelling in wrecks on the sea bed.

_Description:_ Ghouls appear as emaciated, animated corpses with sharp teeth and long fingernails to which shreds of corpse-flesh are sometimes attached. Their voices are weird and eldritch, sometimes described as “meeping” and “glibbering”.

Liches are the remains of powerful wizard-priests who, through fell magics and sinister grimoires, have cheated death and live on beyond the grave in a decaying shell that still revels in awesome magical energies. Unholy magics and an unwavering devotion are not the only things keeping them on the prime material plane. Their souls are already traded to dark gods, but a spark of their essence remains that must be encased in a talisman of sorts. This trinket is a requirement of their Unlife, but no scholar knows how or why this is.

The lair of a lich will often be a complex underworld maze or a wickedly diseased stretch of thick wilderness, at whose black heart resides a tower riddled with magic traps and deadly guardians. Liches do not suffer the fools who would tread upon their mysteries.

Each lich will be able to cast an impressive battery of spells, and those with magic user abilities will have multiple copies of powerful spell tomes. Their magical ability, at a minimum, must be 18th, as only those mortals have travelled so far down the path of magic have even a hope of mastering the rituals of Lichdom. The mere touch of a lich will inflict 2 dice of cold damage upon the victim, and they must save vs paralysation or be held frozen to the spot for 3d8 turns. Anything below 6th level beholding a lich (even in a reflection or a projected image) must save vs magic or never return to the area again.

Often dressed in rich decaying rags that were exquisite in life, liches are now horrors to behold. They are cadaverous in appearance, with unholy pin-points of green light emanating from the otherwise empty pits that are the eye-sockets of its fleshless skull. Diseased and leprous tatters of meat cling feebly to ancient bones, reeking with the rot of the grave.

Liches are believed to feast on Soul Worms.

_Treasure:_ (1d4+1)×1,000 cp (30%); (d4+1)×1,000 sp (25%); 1d6×1,000 ep (40%); (1d8+1)×1,000 gp (45%); 1d4×1,000 pp (25%); 5d8 gems (55%); 8d4 jewellery (45%); any 3 magic items save potions (40%)

The undead mummy exists both on the normal and negative material planes. Normally found in tombs or other burial places, they hate life and attempt to destroy any living creature they encounter.

The touch of a mummy causes a wasting and rotting disease which will cause death within 1d6 months. For each month of affliction, the victim permanently loses 2 points of charisma, and while diseased no _cure wound_ spells will have any effect and any wounds will naturally heal at a 10% rate. The mummy rot can only be cured by a _cure disease_ spell.

All creatures within 60-ft of a mummy, upon sight, will suffer the effects of fear and revulsion unless a successful saving throw vs magic is made. If the save fails, the victim will be paralysed for 1d4 rounds. Groups of creatures gain a bonus of +1 for their save at a ratio of six creatures for each mummy (for example: 12 creatures in sight of 1 mummy gain a +2 to save; 12 creatures in sight of 2 mummies gain a +1, and 12 creatures within sight of 3 or more mummies gain no bonus). If humans confront a mummy, then each human will gain a +2 to his or her save.

A mummy cannot be harmed by normal weapons, and magical weapons do only half damage (drop all fractions). A mummy is immune to sleep, hold spells, charm spells, and cold based attacks. Poison and paralysis have no effect on the creature. A _raise dead_ spell will transform the monster into a 7th-level fighter unless the mummy makes a successful save vs magic (unlisted categories).

A mummy is susceptible to fire as follows: a hit from a torch will deal 1d3 hp damage, a flask of burning oil causes 1d8 hp on the first round and 2d8 hp on the second round, and magical fires deal +1 for each die of damage. Holy water inflicts 2d4 hp per vial that hits.

Any character killed by a mummy cannot be raised due to the amount of damage caused by the rotting waste unless a _cure disease_ and _raise dead_ are both cast on the victim within one hour of death.

_Treasure:_ 1d8×1,000 cp (10%), 1d12×1,000 sp (15%), 1d8×1,000 ep (15%), 1d6×1,000 gp (50%), 1d10 gems (30%), 1d6 jewellery (25%), any 2 magic item+1 potion (15%)

Poltergeists are non-corporeal and invisible spirits of humans who have died a tragic death or were murdered in cold blood. So far as is known, all poltergeists were formerly human or at least half-human. They are only rarely encountered as a wandering monster but in such a case can be treated as a type 1 undead for purposes of turning or disrupting. More often, however, the poltergeist is in the area where it met its untimely end. The poltergeist's bond to this area is strong and turning is much more difficult, treat the poltergeist as a turning a type 3 undead in this case.

In combat, the poltergeist can only be struck by magical or silver weapons and its invisibility will cause all attacks against it to be made at -4 (unless the attacker can see invisible). It will not cross over sprinkled holy water, though after the holy water dries it is no longer effective at warding them. Holy water does not cause actual harm to poltergeists. A cleric can strongly present a holy symbol to keep them at bay as well, but again this does not harm the creature.

Poltergeists cannot physically attack. Instead they hurl objects with a telekinetic power at their opponents, attacking as a 5 HD monster. These objects must be light enough to be thrown by a standard human; books, torches, lamps, chairs and so on. A poltergeist's lair will include many such objects. Anyone struck takes no damage, but he or she must save vs spells or flee at top movement speed for 2d12 rounds. A fleeing victim has a 50% chnce to drop whatever is held in his or her hands, but not necessarily right away. When a PC succumbs to the poltergeist's _fear_ effect, determine how many rounds he or she will flee, then roll the dice again to determine on which round hand held items will be dropped. Once an opponent has made his or her saving throw, that individual will be immune to further fear for that encounter only and from that poltergeist only if more than 1 are present.

Shadows flitter about old ruins and dusty dungeons, seeking the living. Their ties to the negative material plane cause living things they hit in melee to lose a point of Str, Dex or Con. The attribute drained is random; but once determined further attacks by the same pack of shadows drain the same attribute until that statistic reaches zero—at which point the victim becomes a shadow under the control of the creature that drained the last point. Points drained, but not brought to nil, will return to the victim after about an hour, but some shadow attacks take longer to recover from.

Due to their partial immaterialness, they can only be hit by magic weapons or certain spells. Cold attacks are useless, as are _sleep_, _hold_, and spells that affect the mind. They are nearly undetectable in their normal conditions, requiring an 18 or better on a d20 to be aware of them before they attack. Infravision does not detect them as they do not radiate heat, but magical light is sufficient to reveal these horrors for what they are.

Some shadows attack victims in their sleep, giving them night-mares from which they never wake, as their physical forms are drained of life by the shadows' horrid ties to worlds beyond mundane reckoning.

These things are the result of an evil (or neutral at best) magic user or cleric wielding magics that animate the fleshless remains of humans, demi-humans, and various humanoids. They are completely mindless, only obeying the simple commands of their animator, which is often limited by the spell itself to a score of words. Some sages speak, though, of the mere proximity to great evil can animate the dead, resulting in armies of these horrors springing to unlife in forgotten catacombs and foul dungeons. Though given no commands, they seek out the living and attempt to force them into the ranks of the dead.

No matter how a skeleton attacks, whether rusty blade, a stone, or its own former femur, it always deals 1d6 damage. Cold and spells that attack the mind have no affect on skeletons. They take less damage from edged and cutting weapons, typically reducing the damage by half. Most piercing weapons, like arrows and spears, do but 1 or 2 points maximum per attack. Holy water inflicts 2d4 hp per vial that strikes.

These fiendish shades dwell primarily on the negative material plane. Thus, when their barely-material forms come in contact with the living, they drain two levels of experience from the victim. Those reduced below zero energy levels become half-strength spectres under control of the one that stole their life-force. The living In turn can only affect spectres with magic weapons (of at least +1 value) or spells. Elemental spells and enchantments that affect the mind have no power over spectres. Liquids blessed by the gods still inflict damage upon them. If a cleric (good or evil) attempts to restore a spectre back to life via a spell or ritual, the spectre must make a saving throw or its existence is removed from the plane that fuels its unlife and it becomes naught in the world of living.

Some sages speculate that spectres have no power in sunlight, but no one has ever proved this theory.

The vampire is one of the most feared of the undead. Being similar to other undead, they dwell simultaneously in the negative material and material planes. They share other undead's immunity to _charm_, _hold_, and _sleep_ spells. Electricity and cold does only half damage, they are unaffected by normal weapons, and they regenerate 3 hit points per round. Vampires must take refuge in a coffin or other hide-away during daylight, and must slumber on soil from their own grave once in a while to maintain their powers.

Vampires are immensely strong (18.76), and deal great blows that inflict 1d6+4 hit points of damage. These blows further reduce the victim's life energy by two levels, which consequently reduces all other traits linked to a loss in levels (attack ability, hit dice, etc.).

Vampires may take gaseous form at will, and will be forced into this form if their hit points reach zero. They then attempt to reach their coffin to reform their bodies. If they do not reach the coffin within 12 turns and rest for 8 hours, they are unable to reform.

Further, vampires may shape change into a large bat at will, which grants them flying movement. They can summon 1d10×10 bats or rats when underground or 3d6 wolves when above. These creatures will arrive in 2d6 rounds. In addition, a vampire has a _charm_ gaze (as the _charm person_ spell), with a saving throw penalty of -2.

Although these items do not actually cause harm or completely repel these creatures, vampires will draw back from a lawful good holy symbol, a mirror, or garlic if they are presented with confidence. Garlic causes a vampire to cringe for 1d4 rounds, and a holy symbol or mirror will cause a vampire to take a position in which the item does not impede his or her progress or attack. A lawful good holy symbol will affect a vampire no matter what its ethos was in life. Holy water will inflict 1d6+1 points of damage per full vial which strikes.

There are few means by which a vampire may be destroyed. They take great damage from immersion in running water, and will be killed in 3 rounds (each round reduces 1/3 of the creature's hit points). If caught in sunlight a vampire becomes powerless and will die in 1 turn. Finally, a stake through the heart, coupled with decapitation, will destroy a vampire if holy sacraments (such as wafers) are placed in the mouth after the head is removed. If a vampire is staked he or she will appear to die, but unless also decapitated the vampire will revive when the stake is removed.

Vampires create others of their kind by draining humans or humanoids of all life energy. The victim must be buried. After 1 day he or she will arise as a vampire. The victim will retain class abilities he or she had in life but will become a chaotic evil undead being. The new vampire is a slave to the vampire that created him or her, but becomes free willed if the master is killed.

There is a variant type of vampire from the east, which cannot assume gaseous form at will (but will if reduced to zero hit points), nor does it have a _charm_ gaze. However, it is invisible and foes that cannot _detect invisibility_ suffer -4 to strike these vampires in combat.

_Treasure:_ 1d20×1,000 sp (10%); 1d12×1,000 ep (10%); 1d10×1,000 gp(40%); 1d8×100 pp(35%); 3d10 gems(20%); 1d10 jewellery (10%); 3 magic items (30%).

Wights are undead corpses risen with a twisted intelligence. Their undead power is linked to the negative material plane, and thus they permanently drain a level of experience from victims when they score a hit in combat. Although they are not damaged by sunlight, they loathe the rays of the sun and do not emerge by choice from their barrows and lairs during daylight. Wights are immune to _sleep_, _hold_, _cold_, and enchantment spells. They take 2d4 points of damage from holy water (per vial), and are destroyed by the casting of a raise dead spell. A human killed by a wight becomes a wight under the control of its maker.

Wraiths are insubstantial undead creatures that exist partially in the negative material plane, giving them the power to drain one level of experience when they score a hit upon an opponent. In sunlight, the wraith cannot drain levels. Wraiths are shadowy, man-like shapes, dark and indistinct.

Silver weapons inflict only half damage upon a wraith; magical weapons inflict full damage. They are immune to cold damage, _charms_, _sleep_ and _hold_ spells.

Zombies are the risen corpses of the dead. In many cases they have been animated by a powerful spell caster, though sometimes zombies rise from other supernatural influences. These creatures shuffle slowly into combat; they are always the last creatures to attack in a melee round regardless of initiative rolls. Once they begin to attack, they never flee unless turned by a cleric. Zombies are immune to enchantments, _hold_ spells, and any spell that inflicts damage from cold.

Monster zombies are the animated corpses of larger humanoid monsters such as bugbears, ettins or ogres. They are harder for a cleric to turn than a normal zombie.

Juju zombies are undead specially created by evil magic users practising a little-known and universally-banned magic known as necromancy. This unholy process involves draining all the life force from the unfortunate victim, who can be a human, demi-human, or humanoid. These creatures are then completely subservient to their master, who can issue commands to them to guard, attack, or patrol an area, or other similar orders. Juju zombies are like regular zombies but are improved in virtually every way. This type of zombie moves more quickly, has an improved AC, climbs with the skill of an 8th level thief, attack as 6 HD monsters, use missile weapons such as crossbows or pulled bows, and can even use hurled weapons such as spears or javelins.

In combat, juju zombies attack with their clawed hands but they can be programmed to use weapons by their master. Due to their strong connection to the Negative Material Plane, juju zombies can only be hit by magic weapons. Magic piercing or blunt weapons do half damage owing to the undead nature of the monsters, magic slashing weapons do full damage.

Juju zombies are immune to all mind altering magic including, but not limited to: _illusion_, _charm_, _hold monster_, _death_, _cold_, and _sleep_. These monsters are also immune to poison and electrical damage, while fire or fire based magic does only half damage. Acid and holy water attacks do full damage. Juju zombies can be turned, but are more resistant to a cleric's divine powers than regular zombies, hence harder to turn.

The appearance of a juju zombie is much the same as a regular zombie but their leathery, greyish flesh is less decayed than the standard variety. The hatred for life of these obscene creations causes their eyes to burn with a hellish red glow.

_Treasure:_ None.

## Animals

The creatures in this section are “animals” for the purposes of magic such as animal summoning or invisibility to animals. Some kindly GMs may permit other creatures, such as dinosaurs or giant invertebrates, to count as “animals” in terms of such magic—but this is strictly at the GM's option.

Ordinarily sighted in remote rainforests and similar places, the ape will only fight if forced to do so. If it hits one opponent with both hands in the same round, it will do an additional 1d6 damage as it mangles its victim.

_Treasure:_ None.

**Carnivorous Ape:** Bigger, meaner, and spoiling for a fight, in contrast with its more peaceable cousin, this more intelligent variant lusts for human flesh to devour. Its keen senses render it unlikely to be surprised (1 on 1d6). Its mangling attack, initiated if both hands hit the same opponent in a round of combat, does 1d8 damage.

Carnivorous apes are sometimes found in company with hobgoblins.

Communal and vegetarian, baboons will defend their territory if it is invaded. Determined resistance will result in flight, rather than facing extinction (90% chance of flight).

Swift-moving burrowers, the badger will defend its territory. Known to mate for life, and when more than one is indicated, the encounter will be with a family. Their pelts will usually bring 1d3×10 gold each, although juvenile pelts are worth considerably less.

The giant badger is simply a larger version of the regular badger. Much rarer, it runs to 3 hit dice, with attacks that do 1d3/1d3/1d6 damage. They are very rare, even in badger-rich areas, but may be encountered in prehistoric “lost world” environments.

This listing includes all types of bats. They will only attack when trapped, seeking to escape. When startled, they will swarm, causing confusion, extinguishing torches, etc. Because of their sonar navigation, their AC can rise to 4 given the right conditions, as they are nimble and swift.

**Giant Bats:** These are giant versions of carnivorous ordinary bats. Their bodies grow up to 3-ft long, and they can have wingspans of up to 6-ft. Highly manoeuvrable, users of missile weapons will suffer a -3 “to hit” penalty unless the attacker's dexterity is 13 or higher. They must land on their intended victims to attack. There is a 1% chance that those so bitten will contract rabies, or some similar blood-borne infection.

The very large mobat is found in warm regions where a plentiful supply of warm-blooded prey is available. As their wingspan can run between 12 and 16-ft, they require a large landing area at the entrance to their cave. With nearly silent flight, they can surprise 50% of the time. They can also emit a terrifying shriek. If a saving throw vs paralysis is failed, the victims (all within a 20-ft radius) may only cover their ears and are thus rendered defenceless. In flight they have an AC of 2, while when grounded their AC becomes 10.

**Black:** Of all bears, the black is the least aggressive. If attacked, they will defend themselves and their cubs. Any hit roll with a paw of 18 or more will result in the target being hugged for the additional damage noted. The black bear is omnivorous, possesses good hearing and smell, but has weak vision.

**Brown:** The brown bear, of which the grizzly is the most famous, is an aggressive strain of bear. Any hit roll with a paw of 18 or more will result in the target being hugged for the additional damage noted. The brown bear is omnivorous, possesses good hearing and smell, but has weak vision. If reduced to zero hit points, the bear will continue to fight until either 1d4 rounds have elapsed or it is reduced to -9 hit points.

**Cave:** The cave bear, a giant relic of past ages, is particularly carnivorous, in contrast to its more omnivorous relatives. Any hit roll with a paw of 18 or more will result in the target being hugged for the additional damage noted. The cave bear possesses good hearing and smell, but has weak vision. If reduced to zero hit points, the bear will continue to fight until either 1d4 rounds have elapsed or it is reduced to -9 hit points.

**Polar:** The polar bear is omnivorous, possesses good hearing and smell, but has weak vision. If reduced to zero hit points, the bear will continue to fight until either 1d4+1 rounds have elapsed or it is reduced to -13 hit points.

Birds are found across the known world in many shapes, forms and colours. They are distinguished from one another by plumage, size, beak shape, body length, wing size and talon type, as well as by dietary habits. Those that fall into a similar size range are provided for here and below; most are two or three feet long, weigh up to about three pounds and have a wing span of around four or five feet.

Eagles, hawks and falcons are birds of prey. Falcons are generally the smallest of the three, tending to be around a foot in length and having a wingspan of two to three feet. Hawks are usually somewhat larger, typically being around two feet long and having a wingspan of four to five feet. Eagles can be considerably larger, sometimes exceeding even three feet in length and having a wingspan of anywhere from five to eight feet. The largest types may weigh up to twelve pounds. All of these are capable of a 'dive' attack, which when made from a distance of 120-ft or more grants them +2 “to-hit” and double damage from their talons. The huge versions of these birds are typically larger and more aggressive, whilst the giant types are thought to be the result of sorcery. Giant birds of prey can make dive attacks from a distance of 60-ft and gain +4 “to hit” as well as inflicting double damage with their talons. Some of these are rumoured to have considerable intelligence and even be capable of speech.

Aggressive omnivore, related to a pig. If more than one is encountered, the others will be sows or sounders on a 1:4 ratio (e.g., 1 boar, 3 sows, 8 sounders). Sows have 3 hit dice, and do 2d4 damage when attacking. Sounders will flee. The boar (bull or sow) will fight for 1d4+1 rounds after reaching 0 hit points, or until -7 hit points are accumulated.

**Giant Boar:** Ancient ancestor to the modern boar, the giant boar is even more aggressive. If 3 or more are indicated, young will only be present 25% of the time. Bulls and sows have the same stats and will both fight to -11 hp, or 1d4 rounds after 0 hp.

Young, when encountered have the following stats: 2-6 HD, between 1d4 and 3d4 damage/attack.

An ornery beast of burden, the camel comes in two types, both of which have the same stats in game terms. The dromedary has only one hump and prefers warm climates. The bactrian camel has two humps, is adaptable to a wider range of temperatures and environments, and moves 30-ft more slowly.

Regardless of the type, all camels can be domesticated, can carry immense loads (up to 6,000 gp, although this will cut their movement in half). Between 4 and 5 thousand gp, speed is reduced to 60-ft.

Their usual attack is a bite, but they will also spit (50%, with a 25% chance to blind for 1d3 rounds).

Agile and proud, cats are found everywhere. Only surprised on a 1 (of a d6), they can surprise on a 1-3 (of a d6). Because of their size, domestic cats have very ineffective attacks.

When a black cat is found as a mage's familiar, the cat confers excellent hearing and night vision on its master or mistress.

A cat exceeding its needed “to hit” score by 4 or more can rake with its rear claws as well as its front, so roll the listed damage twice.

_Giant Lynx:_ Rare and magical, giant lynxes live in the icy wastes, where they use their intelligence to advantage against competing predators. They speak their own language. Giant lynxes have the thief skills Hide In Shadows, Move Silently and Climb Walls at 90% and Find/Remove Traps at 75%. Owing to their camouflaged pelts, they surprise opponents on a 1-4 on 1d6.

**Buffalo:** Native to tropical and subtropical plains, the buffalo will usually attack if approached within 60-ft. Any attack by one may result in the whole herd charging. When charging, the buffalo will do 3d6 impact damage plus 1d4 trampling damage. The charge must cover a minimum of 40-ft.

50% of all buffalo species are non-aggressive and their “charge” will result in flight.

_Treasure:_ None

**Bull:** The bull is very aggressive. If someone moves to within 80-ft, it is likely to charge (75%), even without apparent provocation. The charge will do 3d4 upon impact plus 1d4 trample damage. The charge must traverse a minimum of 30-ft.

_Treasure:_ None

**Wild Cattle:** Skittish and likely to flee at the first whiff of danger, wild cattle keep to their herds. Males have a 75% chance to attack if the herd is surprised, with the goal of covering the escape of the rest of the herd. When flight occurs, the herd will stampede the party 25% of the time.

Stampedes will cause characters to be trampled by 2d4 animals, and take 1d4 damage per animal.

**Giant moray eels** are salt water dwellers with a nasty temper and a mouth full of teeth. Though they will generally keep to themselves if not molested, giant moray eels are often found in the service of locathah (q.v.) as both battle mounts and guards. Giant morays encountered in those circumstances are extremely aggressive. On rare occasions, a giant moray eel will be found in fresh water.

_Treasure:_ None

**Electric eels** are non-aggressive fresh water dwellers, preferring warm water. If an electric eel feels threatened or is attacked it will discharge a jolt of electricity. This electrical charge causes any creature within 5-ft of the eel to take 3d8 points of damage, all creatures within a 5-ft to 10-ft range will take 2d8 points of damage, and all creatures within 10-ft to 15-ft take 1d8 hp damage. No saving throw is allowed, though certain magic items and spells may grant immunity or reduced damage from the electrical attack. Rumours persist of a saltwater electric eel which is double the size and delivers a jolt twice as powerful.

_Treasure:_ None

**Weed eels** are found in both salt and fresh water, preferring depths of around 30-ft. Weed eels are so-called because of their brownish green colouration, and because they tend to anchor themselves in the rocks and dirt of the sea or lake bed, looking for all the world like a bed of sea weed. Weed eels have a single biting attack which injects a powerful poison into the wound: the victim must save or die. A weed eel lair consists of many small tunnels of about 6 inches diameter which eventually join into a series of 6-ft tunnels, which in turn lead to a large cave which is the actual lair. The cave is usually about 600 square-ft and the eels pave the bottom of it with any suitable material they find: small stones, gems, coins, and similar sized shiny objects. Any attempt by anyone or anything other than a weed eel to enter any hole leading to the lair will provoke an immediate attack by every eel in the colony.

_Treasure:_ None carried. In lair: 1d4×1,000 cp (30%), 1d10×1,000 sp (50%), 1d3×1,000 ep (20%), 1d8×1,000 gp (45%), 2d8×100 pp (60%), 6d6 gems (50%), 2d6 jewellery 50%

Elephants are large mammals found in subtropical climates, where they roam wide open plains and grasslands in small herds or families. They have a tough hoary grey hide, four sturdy legs, two large tusks, a great trunk that they use to manipulate their surroundings and two very large ears. African elephants are typically larger than their Asian cousins and have proportionally larger ears, but both are relatively intelligent animals that can be trained to work as beasts of burden and obey simple commands and are occasionally even used for warfare. Mammoths and mastodons are thought to be the ancestors of the common elephant, the principal difference being their great woolly coats, which make them better suited to subarctic environments.

In general, elephants are relatively peaceful creatures, but when roused they can be devastating. All elephants make two attacks with their great tusks for 2d8 damage each, except for the mammoth which strikes for 3d6 damage with each. They may also attack creatures up to medium size with their trunks for 2d6 damage, or 2d8 in the case of the mammoth, as well as attempt to crush their foes with their two forelegs, which can each inflict 2d6 damage. However, no single opponent may be subject to more than two attacks at one time, though elephants can simultaneously combat as many enemies as it has attacks.

_Treasure:_ Ivory is worth 1d6×100 gp per tusk. An elephant tusk is hugely encumbering.

**Giant** **g****ar** live in deep rivers and lakes. They can swallow prey whole on an attack roll of 20, including creatures up to Man-sized. A swallowed person has a cumulative 5% chance per segment of drowning, but if he or she has a cutting weapon, may cut him- or herself free. To do so, 25% of the giant gar's total hp must be inflicted. Any piercing attack against a giant gar has a 20% chance of causing equal damage to a swallowed creature.

**Giant Pike** are aggressive predators found in larger and deeper lakes. They often guard nixies' lairs. Due to their great speed and acuity of vision giant pike will surprise their prey on a 1-4 on 1d6.

**Leviathans** are huge fish that may originate from the deepest oceans or the Elemental Plane of Water. They can overturn small vessels 90% of the time, oceangoing ships 50% of the time and huge vessels 10% of the time.

A successful “to hit” roll inflicts the damage shown and any creature attacked must save vs death or be swallowed whole (see “giant gar” for the effects of this).

Giant frogs can be 2, 4, or 6-ft in length. They are found anywhere their normal-size cousins are. They have natural camouflage and surprise on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. A 2-ft frog weighs 50 lbs and can jump 180-ft, a 4-ft frog weighs 150 lbs and can jump 140-ft, and a 6-ft frog weighs 250 lbs and can jump 100-ft.

The frog can shoot its tongue up to three times its body length and gets a +4 to hit. The tongue does no damage, it only sticks to the victim. Any creature hit with the tongue can attempt to free itself by striking the tongue. If the victim manages to strike the tongue, the frog will retract it and attack a different target next round.

If the victim is not freed and weighs less than the frog, the frog will attempt to pull the victim into its mouth for maximum damage. If the victim weighs more than the giant frog it will take 2 rounds to drag the victim into its mouth. If the victim is more then double the frog's weight, the frog will not be able to move the victim. On the 3rd round the frog will release its tongue.

If the frog scores a natural 20 on an attack, it has swallowed its prey. A giant frog can swallow whole anything elf-sized or smaller. If swallowed, there is a chance for the victim to cut their way out. They must have in hand a sharp edged weapon and score an 18 or better. Prey get three attempts to escape. Any hit to the giant frog, that has swallowed its victim, has a 33% chance of doing damage to the victim as well.

One of the most common domesticated animals, horses are almost ubiquitous in most human societies. They are insufficiently sure-footed to take into most dungeon environments (cf mule). “Heavy”, “Medium” and “Light” refer to warhorses. Only about 10% of horses can be trained as warhorses, even by an expert, and warhorse training requires very specialised knowledge on the part of the trainer.

Hippopotami, or “hippos”, are large semi-aquatic mammals that spend most of their time in the water. They are herbivores but they are quite aggressive in defending their territory and their great size makes them dangerous opponents. This is compounded by the fact that, in spite of the bulky appearance, they can run faster than a human on dry land. Hippos can't float, though they can propel themselves to the surface of the water for a breath of air, and they can stay submerged for 15 minutes at a time.

In combat, a bull bites for 3d6 damage and for every 4 animals in a herd there will be 1 bull. Cows bite for 2d6 damage if pressed into combat. A boat passing over a hippo has a 50% of having the animal surface under the craft, tipping it over.

Hyenas are medium sized mammals, 4-5-ft long and weighing up to around 100 lbs. They are muzzle-snouted, fur-covered, four-legged and long-tailed predators and scavengers that hunt in packs and live in dens in sub-tropical grasslands, woodlands and waste-lands. Many find their haunting, laugh-like bark unnerving and their tendency to raid shallow graves has sometimes earned them an evil reputation.

The jaws of a hyena are very powerful for their size and cause 2d4 damage on a successful attack. They generally retreat to a safe distance when threatened, but will defend their cubs if their lair is invaded. Huge hyenas are a more ferocious type of hyena, but other wise follow the same behaviour patterns. Giant hyenas are relatively unknown; it is thought that they are the result of magical experimentation and their nature is consequently variable.

Jackals are small mammals, 2-ft to 3-ft long and weighing about 25 lbs. They are muzzle-snouted, fur-covered, four-legged and long-tailed nocturnal scavengers and occasional predators. They generally hunt and forage singly or in mated pairs, but occasionally gather in small packs to bring down difficult prey. Jackals can be found in subtropical grasslands, woodlands and wastelands, and occasionally in more mountainous terrain. They are most active at dawn and dusk, which has occasionally led to them being revered by death cults.

The small size of the jackal makes it cautious and an unlikely combatant, but they can bite for 1d4 damage if necessary, such as when defending their cubs. Huge jackals are larger, more aggressive and have a stronger bite, but are otherwise similar. Giant jackals are almost certainly unnatural and are known to often be associated with religious groups. Though they are thought to usually behave as other Jackals, there are rumours that some possess a greater degree of intelligence and an evil will.

All lions gain an extra two rear leg raking claw attacks (for the same damage as their forepaws) if they successfully hit with both clawing attacks in melee.

**Lion:** These prefer warm climates and thrive in any such locale be it jungle or savannah. Lions organise themselves into family units called prides. Males are aggressive fighters, defending the territory and the other members of the pride. The female, referred to as a lioness, does all the hunting. A pride will have 1d2 males and 2d4+1 females. If encountered in their lair, there will be 1d10 cubs in various stages of growth but too immature to fight. All adult pride members will fight to the death to protect the young. Lions cannot climb trees and will only swim under duress.

**Cougar:** Popularly known as mountain lions, these great cats are not true lions but are similar in most respects. Cougars are more solitary than lions and tend to range more widely while hunting. They are also more prone to attack if approached than are true lions. Though they share habitat preferences with lions they also inhabit mountains as well, giving rise to their popular name. Mountain lions can leap 20-ft to attack or spring upwards 15-ft.

**Prehistoric Lion:** Also known as “cave lions” or “spotted lions,” with the exception of their larger size these cats are very similar to regular lions. Cave lions tend to be found in “lost world” type settings but have been encountered in the same areas as ordinary lions.

The Portuguese man o'war can be found in warm salt water, floating on the surface as it trails its poisonous tentacles below. The poison of a man o'war inflicts damage and pa- ralysis, though a saving throw vs poison negates the latter. Creatures succumbing to the man o'war venom are drawn up to the body of the creature and consumed in 3d4 turns. The delicate tentacles can be broken by inflicting 1 hp damage upon them, but this does not hurt the man o'war and the tentacle regrows in 1d3 days. Only damage to the body of the Portuguese man o'war can kill it. Though the man o'war floats on the surface of the water, the creature breathes water and will suffocate if removed from the sea.

_Description:_ Portuguese men o'war comprise a large body dominated by a huge flotation sac and a number of long slender tentacles that trail beneath it in the water. The man o'war's flotation sac is translucent and is unlikely to be seen 90% of the time unless the being encountering them can see invisible. The size of the man o'war and the number of its tentacles is determined by its HD. The man o'war's body will be 2½-ft in diameter for every HD. Thus a 1 HD man o'war will be 2½-ft in diameter and a 3 HD man o'war 7½-ft in diameter. The number and length of its tentacles also vary by HD; there will be ten tentacles per HD, and ten ft of length per HD. Thus, a 3 HD Portuguese man o'war will have 30 tentacles, each of which are 30-ft long.

Rhinoceroses are aggressive quadrupedal herbivores that will charge any creature they can detect. Rhinos have poor eyesight but have a very good sense of smell and excellent hearing. There are 2 common types of rhinos, single horn and double horned. Double horned rhinos are larger, having 9 HD and doing 2d6 damage. The single horn variety has 8 HD and does 2d4 damage.

In combat a rhino will charge, doing double damage on a successful attack. Any opponent on the ground or low to the ground will be trampled for 2d4 damage for each successful foreleg attack.

A woolly rhinoceros is a larger version of the rhino that roams Arctic areas of “lost world” settings, though they can also be encountered in the wild.

Sharks are scavengers of the seas who viciously attack anything that seems wounded or dying. They are attracted to splashing, kicking, or any other sound that can be mistaken for a fish in distress. The smell of blood in the water can attract sharks from miles away. While sharks come in all sizes there are basically three that can be considered man-eaters. When sharks have targeted their prey they will enter a feeding frenzy and attack everything in sight, sometimes even each other. They will swim up and take a bite out of whatever they consider food. Once they have swallowed what they have bitten, they will return for another bite until nothing is left.

Sharks do have a couple of weaknesses. They must remain in constant motion to breathe. If a shark were to be held motionless it would drown. Sharks are also vulnerable to a blunt force blow to their side. This smashes their insides and they die instantly.

These monsters live deep within the oceans at depths few can reach. Occasionally they will surface to attack a passing ship. When these squid attack they will attach themselves with two tentacles to the ship. This leaves the other eight tentacles free to go after the crew. When the squid has picked the ship clean it will crush the hull and drag the wreckage to its lair.

A giant squid's body is protected by a tough shell (AC 3), but its tentacles and head is more vulnerable (AC 7). Each tentacle hits for 1d6 damage. With each successful hit it grabs its victim and holds it. With each successive round the tentacle does an additional 2d6 crushing damage until the victim is dead. It takes one round to eat its dead victim, then the tentacle is free to attack a new target. The squid's sharp beak bites for 5d4 damage. They only way to get a squid to release its victim is to sever the tentacle by causing 10 hp damage to it.

Those within the tentacle's grasp are 25% likely to have both arms held, and as such they are helpless. Most of the time (50%) they will have one limb held and are able to attack with a -3 penalty. The other 25% of the time the victim will both arms free and can attack the squid with only a -1 penalty.

If the squid looses more then 3 arms it will release the ship and flee. As it does the monster will release ink in the water leaving a cloud 60-ft deep by 80-ft wide.

Giant octopi resemble giant squid, but without the shell or two of their arms, and are smaller. Otherwise they are as giant squid.

Tigers are large, carnivorous and very cunning cats ranging from tropical climes to subarctic tundra. Tigers are ruthless and efficient predators, often hunting in pairs or family groups, surrounding their prey and attacking as one. Tigers can climb trees as easily as walking on the ground, leap 40-ft to attack from hiding, move silently at quarter speed in natural settings, and spring upwards 10-ft. Tigers attack with a claw-claw-bite routine. If both claw attacks are successful the tiger has grabbed its victim and gains two additional attacks at +4 “to hit” from its powerful rear legs for 1d6+2 points of damage each. There is a 25% chance a tiger met in its lair will have 1d3 cubs. In such a case, the tiger will fight to the death to defend them. When not defending its young, a tiger generally avoids contact with humans and demi-humans.

Smilodons or sabre-toothed tigers are dangerous and aggressive. These giant cats are generally found in “lost world” type areas with dinosaurs and cave men, but they are sometimes encountered in more standard settings as well. Sabre-tooth tigers conform to their smaller cousins in most respects, including the rear leg bonus attacks (2×2d4 points of damage). Smilodon fangs are long and sharp, backed by powerful jaw muscles; these factors combine to give the sabre-tooth a +2 “to hit” probability for its bite attack.

**Giant sea turtles** are massive beasts, normally placid but ferocious when they feel they are under attack. They have a 90% chance of overturning a boat, and a 10% chance to overturn even a small ship. A sea turtle can withdraw its vulnerable head and flippers into its shell, but obviously cannot attack or move if it does so.

_Treasure:_ None

**Giant snapping turtles** are less massive than giant sea turtles, but they are aggressive predators, lying in wait for prey in the shallow waters of swamps, lakes, and coasts. The turtle's lumpy shell is excellent camouflage, granting it an excellent chance to surprise passing creatures. A giant snapping turtle can retract its legs and head into its shell, but when it is thus protected it obviously cannot attack or move. Like their smaller cousins, giant snapping turtles have disproportionately long necks, and can snap at enemies as far as 10-ft away.

Walruses are large, flippered animals with long ivory tusks. They are carnivorous and very aggressive in defending their territory, and are made every more dangerous due to their great size and the fact several are usually encountered. The largest males can weight as much as 4,400 lbs.

In combat a walrus attacks with its clawed front flippers and its tusks. Males will primarily defend the herd from intruders but the females, who are also tusked, will fight if necessary.

_Treasure:_ The ivory tusks of this animal can be sold for 1d4+1×100 gp on the market.

Huge and giant weasels are typically encountered in forested areas, though some may also be found in dungeons. Their bite drains blood after the first successful attack: 1d8 hp per round for huge weasels, or 2d6 hp per round for the giant version.

Their pelts are quite valuable. Huge weasel pelts sell for 1d6×100 gp, giant weasel pelts for twice that amount or more.

_Treasure:_ See creature text.

As reflected in the statistics above, there is considerable variation between different species of whales and their relative sizes. Larger whales can swallow their prey (or attackers) whole. Digestive juices from the whale cause 1 hit point of damage per turn, and the whale will disgorge prey that attack from the inside, but it may choose to do so in deep water.

_Treasure:_ Whale ambergris from a single whale is worth 1d20×1,000 gp if properly collected. Whale meat is worth 100 gp per hit die of the whale. Additionally, there is a 1% chance each of finding cp, sp, ep, pp, gems, jewellery, and magic items within the stomach of a whale. Coins found will number 1d3×1,000 of the types found, gems and jewellery will number 1d20 if found, and magic items will number 1d4.

Wolves are predators that hunt in packs of up to 30. They are normally 26 to 30 in tall at the shoulder, and males weigh 80 to 100 lbs. A wolf pack's howling may panic horses and other herbivores (50% chance per animal). A wolf pack will encircle prey, seeking to attack from behind. Once a pack has identified possible prey, they usually (75%) follow the group, waiting for the chance to attack.

Dire wolves are massive wolves, prehistoric ancestors of the normal species. Like normal wolves, they hunt in packs and their howl has a 50% chance to panic herbivores such as horses.

Wolverines are deadly predators, resembling a cross between a huge weasel and a small bear. These cold-weather predators can spray musk in a 60-ft cone, which necessitates a saving throw vs poison or the victim will be blinded for 1d8 hours. Regardless of the saving throw's result, the strength and dexterity scores of anyone caught in a musk cloud will effectively be halved. The creatures are just intelligent enough to be evil aligned, and are intelligent enough to ambush prey. Their savagery and speed grants them a +4 on attacks and an unusually good armour class.

Giant wolverines are massive cousins to the normal wolverine.

## Other Creatures

“Other creatures” is a catch-all term for the many OSRIC creatures that do not seem to fit anywhere else.

Though not demons, achaierai are native to the Abyss. They are giant birds, somewhat like ostriches with short necks and four legs each. They attack as 9 hit dice monsters. Their bite attack (1d10 damage) is usable only against foes they can reach—typically those flying or over 8-ft tall. Against smaller creatures they have only two attacks with their talons.

Creatures under 8-ft tall, however, are at an equal disadvantage against achaierai. They may hit the creature's body (AC 8) only with missile weapons, spears or polearms (such as pikes). If armed with a hand weapon, they must attack the achaierai's legs (AC -1).

If seriously wounded, such as losing more than two legs, the achaierai can emit a cloud of poison in a 20-ft diameter sphere. This cloud causes insanity (as the druidic spell _feeblemind_) for three hours unless a saving throw vs poison is made, inflicts 2d6 hp damage regardless of the save, and blocks line of sight.

_Treasure:_ 1d10×1,000 cp (5%), 1d12×1,000 sp (25%), 1d6×1,000 ep (25%), 1d8×1,000 gp (25%), 1d12 gems (15%), 1d8 jewellery (10%) and 3 magic items and 1 scroll (25%)

Aerial servants are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air. They may be encountered on the æthereal or astral planes (and are visible there), but are more typically met when conjured by a clerical spell aerial servant. On the Prime Material Plane, aerial servants are invisible.

These creatures may carry approximately 1,000 lbs in weight at full movement speed, and are immensely strong.

If the aerial servant is prevented from carrying out its mission, it will go mad and return to attack the cleric who summoned it.

Afreeti are creatures from the elemental plane of fire. They can travel the material plane, the elemental planes, and the astral plane. They are the enemies of the genies and will attack them on sight. If an afreet can be subdued it will serve for 1,001 days or until it has granted three wishes. Once their service is complete they will be freed and can not be subdued again. Once an afreet is freed, be warned: they are vengeful, cruel, and manipulative.

An afreet can perform the following once per day. They can grant three wishes, _detect magic_ at will, _enlarge_ themselves 200%, create a _wall of fire_, _polymorph_ themselves, become _invisible_, change to a _gaseous form_, or create an illusion with sight and sound that can be self-controlled. The illusion will last until dispelled or touched. An afreet can cause _pyrotechnics_ and _produce flames_ at will.

Any attack to the afreet that uses normal fire does no damage. An attack that uses magic fire will do so at a -1 penalty.

Afreeti are capable of carrying up to 750 lbs, either on foot or flying, without getting tired. They can carry double the weight on foot but for only 30 minutes at a time. Then the afreet must rest a full hour before resuming the load.

Besides speaking their own language afreeti have limited telepathy, so they can communicate with any intelligent creature.

An amber creeping vine is a climbing plant with striking amber flowers like honeysuckle blooms that exude a musky, heady perfume. Upon reaching maturity each vine covers about 20 square-ft, has 2d6 blooms and 1d4 buds. Not only does the amber creeping vine not require sunlight to grow, it actually appears to thrive in the absence of light. Amber creepers are often found growing in the soil of caverns and dungeons or in the deep, dark hearts of ancient forests, climbing up the rock walls or clinging to tree trunks alike with ease. Indeed, the problem is not getting the vines to grow, it is controlling their spread. These plants can defend themselves and there are those who take advantage of these abilities by planting amber creeping vines near treasure troves.

Amber creeping vines sustain themselves by feeding on living creatures unfortunate enough to approach too close. When a creature approaches within 10-ft of the vine its amber blossoms will start waving in a mesmerising pattern while puffing clouds of fragrant pollen into the target's face. A successful hit indicates the victim has inhaled the pollen and he or she must save vs spells or become enthralled, walking forward into the mass of vines to be engulfed within its leafy, tentacle-like limbs. The individual will resist any attempts to restrain him or her from entering the vines.

Once the victim is inside the plant, numerous root-like organs will intrude into his or her skull. The amber creeping vine will begin to consume the unfortunate victim's brain at a rate of 1d4 intelligence points per round. Though the brain-consuming tendrils can be easily cut, so many attach to the victim so rapidly that the only way to stop the draining is to kill the creeper. The amber creeping vine has a bulbous root which lies 1-ft beneath the soil; stabbing through the root will kill the vine and halt the consumption of the victim's brain tissue.

If the intelligence drain is not halted before the victim's intelligence ability score reaches zero, the victim dies and a bud flowers into bloom as a new bud sprouts from the vine. If the intelligence drain in any given round reduces the victim's intelligence to exactly 1 or 2, the victim becomes an amber zombie (see below). Intelligence loss in persons the creeper does not kill or transform into an amber zombie is temporary, requiring but a day of rest to regain a point of Int. _Healing_ or other curative magic will restore full intelligence immediately, but a spell used thus will not heal hit points.

Each amber creeping vine will have a number of zombies under its control equal to half the number of blooms, rounded down. Creepers do not value treasure but the belongings of those who have fallen victim to the plant's pollen attack will be found in the soil under the plant. The vines are mobile enough to cover the evidence of the plant's peculiar feeding habits.

Amber zombies have varying appearances but are always human, demi-human, or humanoid. Succumbing to the amber creeping vine turns the skin amber and changes the eyes into glazed and lifeless parodies of their former appearance. The process of draining a victim's intelligence also plants a vine seed into the skull. The resulting amber zombie is under control of the plant which created it. The zombie will seek to bring new victims to the creeper's hungry vines and if the creeper is attacked the amber zombie will defend it. Amber zombies use whatever weapons and armour the victim had at the time of his or her conversion, but the zombie fights as 2 HD monster with no spell-using abilities or ability score bonuses.

Despite their name, amber zombies are not undead and cannot be turned by a cleric. They are, however, immune to mind-influencing magic just as true zombies are. After 2 months of service the zombie wanders away from the parent plant to find a nice patch of soil in a likely spot, where it dies and a new amber creeping vine sprouts from the corpse.

The only known way to cure an amber zombie is to kill the controlling creeper and cast both a _neutralise poison_ and _heal_ upon the zombie in rapid succession. The victim will be restored to his or her former self but will require a full week of rest for every 4 points (rounded up) of intelligence lost before being able to adventure again.

Ankheg are gigantic burrowing arthropods with chitinous shells. They can subsist on filtered earth, but are not averse to meat. If necessary an ankheg can spit digestive acid with a range of 30-ft. This uses up its stock of acid, which will not be replenished for half a day, and inflicts 4d8 hp damage to a single target (saving throw vs breath weapons for half damage).

When feeding, an ankheg dissolves its prey before sucking the juices from the shrunken husk, like a spider. This attack inflicts 1d4 hp damage per round.

Ankheg sometimes lurk beneath the earth waiting to feel the vibrations of an approaching creature, thence to attack it by surprise.

These magical, evil giantesses are gaunt and ragged, wearing stained and filthy garments. They are anthropophagic by choice, though they will eat almost anything when hungry, which is almost all the time. They are sometimes found cohabiting with giants or trolls. Annises are as strong as hill giants (19 strength) and if all three of their attacks hit, they have held their opponent fast and will devour it rapidly (in game terms, this means their attacks automatically hit while the victim is held). Annises can cast _fog_ _cloud_ and _change self_ each thrice per day.

Annises speak common, various giantish tongues and their own language.

If the encounter is with a colony of giant ants, the Number Encountered will represent the workers present. Calculate the presence of soldiers at 1:5, that is 1 soldier for every 5 workers, in addition to the number shown on the die.

At the heart of the nest will be the queen. She is immobile and incapable of attacking or defending herself. At least 5d10 workers and 5 soldiers will attend her and defend her and her eggs. Once slain, the queen's organising influence on the colony will disappear, causing _confusion_ (as the 7th level druid spell) for 1d6 rounds. After the period of confusion, ants will leave the colony in search of a new one. Ordinarily, the eggs of giant ants have no market value.

Also known as the “golden gorger” for its beautiful golden coat, the aurumvorax is a long-bodied, eight-legged carnivore. It lives in plains or woods. Though as small as a badger, the creature is very dense and heavy, weighing as much as a bear. A successful bite means the creature has locked its teeth in its target like a bulldog; it will then bring its claws up to rake the target, who will suffer 2d4 damage automatically each round from the teeth while the creature is attached, and an additional 1d8 attacks from the claws. Each claw inflicts a further 1d6 damage. Once locked on, the only way to detach the aurumvorax from its target is to kill it.

The aurumvorax's thick coat is such good armour it takes only half-damage from blunt weapons. It is also highly resistant to fire, taking only half damage from fiery sources, and neither poison nor gas can harm it.

Rumour has it the aurumvorax is not native to this part of the prime material plane, having been brought here by visitors from a very distant place.

_Treasure:_ The aurumvorax does not hoard treasure and places no value on it. However, its lair might contain treasure assigned by the GM—this would be appropriate in cases where it has slain a creature carrying treasure and dragged that creature back to its lair.

So-called for their weird and incomprehensible tongue that no human or demi-human has ever succeeded in learning, babblers may be a kind of mutant lizard man—though if so, the mutation is quite extreme. They live in swamps and marshes and are yellow in colour with blotches of grey and grey underbellies. They look like miniature tyrannosaurs with longer arms, and can move bipedally though they are better adapted to quadrupedal movement (but they can only use their claws effectively when standing upright). When on their bellies in a swamp, they are hard to detect and may hide like a 5th level thief.

Babblers like the taste of human. They are occasionally found in lizard man raiding parties.

Barghests are native to Gehenna, but send their young to the Prime Material Plane during a larval phase. A typical litter is 2d4 young. These will disperse into pairs or lone barghests.

They seem like very large goblins, and may shape change into large dogs at will. In dog form each barghest's movement speed is doubled and it surprises opponents 50% of the time. For each human the barghest eats, it gains 1+1 HD, reduces its AC by 1, adds 5% to its magic resistance and +1 to its damage dice. When it reaches 12+12 hit dice, the barghest may _plane shift_ itself back to Gehenna, a power it will typically use at once.

At will, a barghest may use the following spell-like powers, once each per round: change self, levitation, misdirection, or projected image. While in dog form it may also pass without trace at will. Once each per day it may _charm person_ and _dimension door_.

A barghest that takes more than 15hp damage from a fire attack must save vs spells or be instantly banished back to Gehenna.

_Treasure:_ None on the Prime Material Plane

Noting the basilisk's physiognomy, the wisest sages posit that it is hatched by a cock from the egg of a serpent, begetting an 8-legged anfractuous creature with a lizard-like head. The gaze of the basilisk is deadly, as any creature meeting its gaze must successfully save vs petrifaction or instantly be turned to stone. The gaze effects of the basilisk extend into both the astral and æthereal planes.

Giant bees live in hives (honeybees) or nests (bumblebees). These lairs will contain non-combatant queens (10 HD but no effective attack) and 2d3 non-combatant drones (2 HD and no effective attack). A giant bee can only sting once per encounter; it has a 25% chance of dying after stinging, otherwise the stinger will slowly regrow. They will flee from smoke or fire unless their lair is threatened.

Giant bee hives or nests will always contain honey worth 10d10 gold pieces. There is a 15% chance that a hive will contain royal jelly. If it does, the royal jelly can be fashioned into 2d3 potions of extra healing by a magic user of 7th or higher level—or a magic user of 12th level or higher may make it into an unguent which preserves the appearance of youth. Regular application of this unguent for 1 year makes the user appear 2d3 years younger. Such an unguent is typically worth 3d6x1,000 gp to wealthy noblewomen.

**Giant Bombardier:** Frequently found in forested regions, this beetle primarily scavenges for food above ground. It will collect decaying matter into a large heap and there lay its eggs.

When attacked it has a 50% chance to release an 8-ft cube of noxious gas. The gas will cause 3d4 hp of damage and the sound of its release will stun (20% chance) and deafen (20%) all within a 16-ft radius. The stun effect will prevent action for 2d4 rounds and the deafness will persist for 2d6 rounds. The cloud can be released every 3rd round (e.g., 1st and 4th) but not more than twice in 8 hours.

_Treasure:_ None

**Giant Boring:** Giant boring beetles will often be found in dead trees and tunnel complexes—wherever there is sufficient rotting wood and moisture to support the fungal cultures they eat. There are rumours that some have developed a “hive-mind” similar to ants and when threatened they may display surprising group intelligence in the defence of their home.

_Treasure:_ In Lair: 1d12×1,000 cp (20%); 1d6×1,000 sp (30%); 1d4×1,000 ep (10%); 2d4×100 gp (40%); 1d6×10 pp (50%); 3d8 gems (55%); 1d12 jewellery (45%); 2d4 potions (40%); 1d4 scrolls (50%); Any 2 magic items (10%)

**Giant Death Watch:** Giant Death Watch beetles live in temperate areas and sometimes underground. They disguise themselves by sticking rubbish, branches and detritus to their carapaces with their saliva. They are feared for making terrible, deadly bass vibrations by scraping their hind legs—when a beetle does this, all within 30 ft of the creature must save vs death or die. Even those who pass their save take 4d6 hp damage. After using this special attack, the Death Watch beetle must wait at least 12 turns before using it again.

_Treasure:_ None

**Giant Fire:** With their glowing red glands, one above each eye and one on the back of the abdomen, these nocturnal beetles are much sought after by adventurers. The glands will continue to glow for 1d6 days after removal, illuminating a 10-ft radius without fail.

Fire beetles can be found both above and below ground, feeding on decaying matter like all beetles.

Treasure: None

**Giant Rhinoceros:** Usually encountered in the tropics, these massive creatures (roughly 12-ft long, plus another 6-ft of horn) live on the fruit and vegetation they crush as they roam about.

_Treasure:_ None

**Giant Stag:** Giant stag beetles live in woodlands near farmland, preferring for food the young shoots of cultivated grains. For this reason, they can often plague regions and even cause famine should enough of them descend upon an area.

_Treasure:_ None

**Giant Water:** Hunting by scent and vibration, and dwelling in fresh water at least 30-ft deep, the water beetle is a powerful threat to the unwary adventurer. Omnivorous and insatiable, the water beetle will consume whatever it can get its powerful mandibles around.

A behir is a particularly nasty subterranean beast with a crocodile's head on a 40-ft long snake-like body with twelve sets of legs. These creatures move very fast and can climb vertically at half their speed. Their main method of attacking is to bite and wrap their body around their prey and squeeze. On the second round they can still bite but the held victim is now subject to 6 claw attacks. Every 10 rounds a behir can also breathe a 20-ft lightning bolt that does 4d6+24 damage unless a save vs breath is made for half damage. Occasionally (on a 20) a behir will swallow its victim whole.

_Treasure:_ Inside the beast's stomach will be 10d4 gems (60%), 1d8 jewellery (30%), and a misc. magic item that can survive its digestive juices (10%)

Blindheims are found in subterranean environments. These yellowish, frog-like humanoids project twin beams of incredibly bright light from their eyes. Anyone who comes within 30-ft of the blindheim must save vs aimed magic items or be temporarily blinded (for 1d8+12 turns). The saving throw is at -3 if the approaching character has infravision.

A character who is not blinded may attack the blindheim at a penalty of -2 “to hit” (if he or she is avoiding looking at the creature) or as normal (if he or she is for some reason immune to bright light).

_Treasure:_ In lair only: 2d6×1,000 cp (20%), 1d6×1,000 sp (35%), 1d6×1,000 ep (20%), 1d4 gems (20%), 1d4 jewellery (25%), random magic item or weapon (15%)

Blink dogs are medium-sized dogs, dark brown with white highlights. Blink dogs are intelligent, as smart as the average human, and communicate amongst themselves via their high-pitched barks and low growls. Blink dogs are so-called because they can use a limited form of teleportation, called a “blink,” in a somewhat random fashion and at random intervals.

In combat these amazing dogs use the ability to their advantage, blinking either behind or in flanking position of their opponents (negating dexterity bonuses to AC and shield bonus to AC, if applicable) 75% of the time. Coupled with their pack hunting tactics, blink dogs are fearsome opponents. In combat a blink dog will teleport on roll of 12 or greater on a 1d20. A second roll of the 1d20 reveals where the dog reappears: 01-15 = behind, 16-18 = non-shielded or right flank, 19 = shielded or left flank, 20 = front. If the pack takes more than 25% losses all will simultaneously blink out and not return. There is a long-standing hatred between blink dogs and coeurls and the two will attack each other on sight. Blinking is a natural ability for these animals and they will never materialise in an occupied space or within a solid object.

If a blink dog lair is found there is a 60% chance of 3d4 pups. These younglings fight as 1 HD monsters and inflict 1d2 points of damage per attack, though they are far more likely to flee using their teleportation ability. A captured pup will make a loyal companion to a good aligned human, or, it can be sold for 1,500 gp (± 100-600 gp). A blink dog lair will contain treasure, see below.

_Treasure:_ In lair only: 2d6×1,000 cp (20%), 1d6×1,000 sp (30%), 1d6×1,000 ep (15%), 1d6 gems (20%), 1d4 jewellery (25%), random magic item or weapon×2 (15%).

Bulettes are sometimes called “land sharks” because of their habit of burrowing while the crests of their backs break the surface. Like sharks, they are huge, vicious, and always hungry. They seem to be someone's experiment gone wrong: a turtle crossed with an armadillo with just a touch of demon thrown in. Their favourite food is horse but they will eat just about anything that moves. The only kind of meat they don't seem to like is dwarf or elf. They have been know to dig halflings right out of their holes.

Being fearless, a bulette will attack anything that moves on sight. They have been known to attack a armed party to get at the horses. When they attack, they use their vicious bite and their two front claws. They are well armoured, but have two vulnerable spots: under their chests is a soft spot, only AC 6; and a bulette's eyes are relatively unprotected, with an AC of 4. When cornered or seriously wounded, a bulette will attempt to leap 8-ft vertically and land directly on top of their victim, clawing with all four feet.

Because they are artificially-created animals no one is sure how bulettes reproduce. It seems that a pair will share a territory, but no lair has ever been found. Their plates are highly prized by armourers. They can be easily fashioned into +1 or +2 shields.

_Treasure:_ None

Carbuncles are minor agents of chaos. They seem to be curious little animals like armadillos, and they feed on leaves and small insects. Set in the carbuncle's head above its eyes is a large ruby (randomly-determined value of at least 500 gp). If the beast dies, any ruby attached to it shatters and cannot be reconstituted—but it can voluntarily give up its gem, in which case the gem will re-grow over a period of several months (re-roll the gem's value each time it re-grows). The carbuncle will not normally give up its gem unless charmed or otherwise enchanted.

Carbuncles are empathic and communicate via a minor form of telepathy. They will approach and seek to join a party of humans or demi-humans and then try to spread discord by means of lies, bearing false witness, or betraying the party's presence to nearby monsters.

A fearsome, subterranean omnivore, the carcass creeper has been described as the magical hybrid of a cutworm and a squid. It requires a steady supply of fresh corpses in which to lay its eggs.

The armoured head belies a tender, vulnerable body so the creeper will rely on its speed and many paralysing tentacles to protect itself as it secures prey. Each of the tentacles has a 2-ft reach, although larger specimens are not unknown.

_Treasure:_ In Lair: 1d8×1,000 cp (50%); 1d6×1,000 sp (25%); 1d4×1,000 ep (25%); 1d3×1,000 gp (25%); 1d8 gems (30%); 1d4 jewellery (20%); 1 sword, armour, or misc. weapon(20%)

Caryatid columns share many similarities to stone golems, being created in much the same way. They appear as intricately-carved columns in the shape of a person, usually in pairs. The most common type is maidens, however they can resemble practically anyone. In their dormant state they are almost indistinguishable from a normal statue. The only indication of their true nature is a faint outline of sword held in one hand. They are created as guardians and will animate only when triggered by a certain event. Their trigger must be something simple like someone entering a room, lifting a chest, or opening a door. Once animated they will do their utmost to prevent the trigger from continuing. When their task is complete they will return to their previous place and form.

The caryatid column's main purpose is not combat, but if pressed they will use their swords and attack. They attack as 5 HD monsters. Normal weapons do half damage and magical weapons score full damage, but without their additional magical effects. Additionally any weapon that hits a caryatid column has a 25% chance of breaking. For each plus that the weapon has reduces the chance of breaking by 5%; consider any magical weapons without any pluses as a +1.

_Treasure:_ None

A caterwaul is a feline predator that stalks darkened caves waiting for prey to walk past. These unusual creatures resemble black panthers walking upright. On their hind legs they move at 180-ft. They can drop on all fours and sprint very fast (240-ft) but only for short distances. Using their claws they can scale vertical walls with only a 5% chance of slipping. Being feline, they retract their claws to move silently (75%). Because of their soft coat, they are able to hide in shadows 75% of the time. They also possess keen senses and can only be surprised 10% of the time.

When they pounce on their victims they make their distinctive screech, doing 1d8 damage to all within hearing range (60-ft). They attack with their usual claw, claw, bite. What makes these creatures unique is their unusually high dexterity. This will vary from individual to individual. Roll d% and check the chart below.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>D%</strong></td><td><strong>AC Bonus</strong></td><td><strong>Attacks/round</strong></td></tr><tr><td>01-30</td><td>0</td><td>1/1</td></tr><tr><td>31-60</td><td>-1</td><td>3/2</td></tr><tr><td>61-90</td><td>-2</td><td>3/2</td></tr><tr><td>91-93</td><td>-3</td><td>2/1</td></tr><tr><td>94-97</td><td>-4</td><td>2/1</td></tr><tr><td>98</td><td>-5</td><td>2/1</td></tr><tr><td>99</td><td>-6</td><td>5/2</td></tr><tr><td>00</td><td>-7</td><td>5/2</td></tr></tbody></table>

The AC bonus applies to the creature's armour class and its dodging saving throws.

The attacks per round works much the same way as for fighters, referring to a full attack routine (claw, claw, bite) rather than individual attacks.

Caterwauls are attracted to shiny items. Thus their treasure hoard will often contain jewellery, gems and gold.

**Large:** The smallest of the monstrous 'pedes, the large has a weak venom (save at +4) that only does 4d4 damage if the saving throw fails. Further, they themselves save at a -2 penalty.

**Huge:** The most common of the monstrous 'pedes, the huge has a weak venom (save at +4), but its venom is lethal if the saving throw fails. Further, they themselves save at a -1 penalty.

**Giant:** The largest known of the monstrous 'pedes, the giant has a relatively powerful venom (no adjustment to saving throw). Death is the result of a failed save, but a successful save still results in 1d8 acid damage. Giant centipedes save without penalty.

**Chimæra:** A chimæra has the hind quarters of a goat, the forequarters of a lion, the wings of a dragon and 3 heads, one each of the aforementioned creatures. The dragon head is capable of breathing fire to a 60-ft distance inflicting 3d8 points of damage. Normal saving throws vs breath weapon apply. The creature may make up to 6 natural attacks per round, two with clawed lion paws, one with each of the goat's head 2 horns, the mighty bite of the lion's maw and another powerful bite by the dragon.

Chimæra language is an imperfect form of the red dragon tongue.

**Gorgimæra:** Like a chimæra, save the goat's head is replaced with that of a gorgon. The gorgon's head breathes a cloud of petrifying gas in a cone 30-ft long and 10-ft radius at the base; and the creature has the dragon head breath weapon as well, with the same effect as a chimæra. They speak the same language as their less powerful relatives.

A cockatrice possesses the physical attributes of both a serpent and a cock. These creatures will have the head, legs and wings of a cock, while the body will be of a serpent. Its wings are functional and allow it to fly. The creature is believed to be from a cock's egg hatched by a serpent.

Although the beast is capable of inflicting light wounds with its beak and talons, the mere touch of the cockatrice is capable of turning any creature to stone. The touched creature must roll a successful saving throw vs petrifaction or be instantly turned to stone. The power of this touch is capable of affecting astral and æthereal beings.

_Treasure:_ 1d10×1,000 cp (5%), 1d12×1,000 sp (25%), 1d6×1,000 ep (25%), 1d8×1,000 gp (25%), 1d12 gems (15%), 1d8 jewellery (10%) and 3 magic items and 1 magic scroll (35%)

Inspired by the work of A.E.Van Vogt, coeurls are vaguely feline predators with twin tentacles. They are black in colour. They feed on what they call the “id” of living creatures—by this they mean their essential life force, not “id” in the Freudian sense. Owing to their alien nature Coeurls are hard to target, hence their low armour class and their ability to roll all saving throws at +6. They can communicate telepathically, though they rarely do so.

Coeurls hate blink dogs (q.v.) and will hunt them down and kill them if possible.

Couatl are a race of brightly feathered serpents with wings. They are rarely encountered and if so, would be in a remote tropical environment. They are often treated as gods by those who serve them, however couatl rarely meddle in human events.

They can polymorph themselves, turn æthereal, and cast magic. Most are equal to a 5th level mage (45%), but a few are 7th level clerics (35%). There are a handful of couatl (20%) who cast as a magic user/cleric. In combat a couatl attacks with its bite that causes 1d3 damage and the victim must save vs poison or die. A couatl can also constrict with its body. A successful attack means the beast has grabbed its victim causing 2d4 damage, with an additional 2d4 damage each round until one or the other is dead.

_Treasure:_ 1d8×1,000 cp (50%), 1d6×1,000 sp (25%), 1d4×1,000 ep (25%), 1d3×1,000 gp (25%), 3d4×100 pp (30%), 2d19 gems (55%), 1d12 jewellery (50%), any 1 magic item (15%)

Crabmen are humanoid amphibious creatures. Each has a tough reddish-brown exoskeleton and pincers in place of hands. In combat crabmen tend to attack with their pincers, inflicting 1d4 points of damage for a successful attack.

Crabmen lair in caves along the seashore and are generally peaceful creatures, though they are often forced to defend themselves from raids.

Crabmen will shun humans for the most part, with two notable exceptions. These creatures prize silver very highly and will attack, on sight, anyone openly carrying silver objects or items which appear to be made of silver. Crabmen will also undergo some sort of tribal frenzy from time to time, forming a group of 30 to 40 individuals and raiding inland. These raids will pillage all property in their path and the crabmen attack any who oppose them.

A crypt thing appears as a cloaked skeleton, but contrary to appearances, is not undead and cannot be turned. They reside in their lairs and never venture forth. A crypt thing will never attack first, they will always let the party attack before they do. If they are not molested they will leave the adventurers alone. If they are attacked then they will respond by activating their teleport ability. All those attempting to attack must save vs spell or be instantly teleported in a random direction. Each individual who fails must roll d%. Those who roll 01-20 are teleported from 100 to 1,000-ft north. Those who roll 21-40 are teleported 100-1,000-ft south. Those who roll 41-60 are teleported 100-1,000-ft east. Those who roll 61-80 are teleported 100-1,000-ft west. Those who roll 81-90 are teleported one dungeon level up. Those who roll 91-00 are teleported one dungeon level down.

This is an advanced form of teleportation. Individuals will arrive safely, not in solid areas like floors or walls. Those who make their save can continue with their attack. A crypt thing can also defend itself with its claw like hands for 1d8 points of damage. Crypt things are immune to non-magical weapons.

Crypt things speak common. If questioned about the disappearance of any comrades, they will say they were disintegrated.

_Treasure:_ 1d3×1,000 cp (20%), 1d4×1,000 sp (25%), 1d4×1,000 ep (25%), 1d4×1,000 gp (30%), 1d6×100pp (30%), 10d6 gems (55%), 5d6 jewellery (50%), 3 magic items (50%)

Dakon are intelligent apes resembling gorillas with light brown colouration, green eyes, and black hands. Dakon are peaceful, fighting only in defence or to regain treasure stolen from them. These apes are likely to be settle anywhere but avoid large expanses of water. They are on good terms with lawful humans and demi-humans and are able to speak the common tongue, but they have a deep mistrust of humanoids and shun them.

In combat dakon attack with a +2 hit probability due to their incredible strength and the knife-edged sharpness of their claws.

**Dark creepers** are short, spindly humanoids with pale skin who like to wrap themselves in loose, dark clothing, leaving little exposed save their eyes and hands. Dark creepers detest sunlight and avoid any light as best they can, dwelling alone in dungeons or profane villages even deeper underground, composed of clans of 75-100 individuals. 25% of the population of a dark creeper village will be female. These villages are always governed by a dark stalker (q.v.).

Solitary dark creepers tend to carry their treasure with them, concealed within the many loose folds of their dark clothing. There is a 20% chance a dark creeper will carry a magic dagger, 15% chance of a magic ring, and 10% chance of either 1d4 gems of random value or 1d3 items of random jewellery. Lair treasure probabilities for a lone dark creeper are 50% for a magic dagger, 10% for a magic ring, 30% for gems or jewellery. To generate treasure for a dark creeper village, multiply individual treasure chances by the number of males, adding 5d20 pp and 5d12 gp.

Dark creepers have all the skills of a 4th level thief along with the following abilities: _Detect magic_ and _create darkness_ for 1 hour in a 50-ft radius from target thrice per day. The creepers' general plan of attack is to use their darkness power to extinguish a party's light sources, then sneak in and destroy all lanterns, torches, oil flasks, and tinderboxes. Any magical sources of light gain a saving throw vs magical cold to negate the affects of darkness upon that item only, if it fails the save it will function normally after 1 hour. After it accomplishes this task, the dark creeper will use its _detect magic_ to find and steal any small magic items it can detect. Though the dark creeper will not fight to the death to steal the party's magic items, it craves them and will take foolhardy chances if it feels it has even a small chance of success. A creeper's darkness power will stop infravision, but it will generally only use it on a party's sources of artificial light. A party travelling in the dark using infravision will not likely be blacked out by the creeper's darkness.

In combat a creeper is AC 0 in darkness, and if it has a magic dagger or magic ring as part of its treasure hoard it will use them. A dark creeper's darkness power can be negated by spells that create light, and in such a case the creeper is only AC 8. When a creeper dies it body magically immolates in a fiercely hot blaze of disgusting purple and green flames. Metal items, including magical items of metal, carried as part of the creeper's treasure hoard have an 80% of surviving this magical fire undamaged. Any magic item damaged by the creeper's death fire will lose its enchantment.

_Treasure:_ See creature text

**Dark stalkers** are the leaders of the dark creepers, though it is not known whether they are dark creepers altered through some means either genetic or magical, or if they are a breed apart. What is known for certain is the dark stalker is much taller than its dark creeper followers and one will be found as the leader of any dark creeper village. In an area settled by at least 25 solitary dark creepers there is a 90% chance there will be a dark creeper in the area, increased by 2% for every 5 additional creepers. A dark stalker is rarely encountered away from his or her clan, but if such an encounter occurs the stalker is probably on some mysterious personal mission and will not engage PCs unless forced to do so.

In combat dark stalkers fight with abilities identical to dark creepers except they favour short swords over daggers and have an additional spell-like ability; _wall of fog_ twice per day as per the spell. Dark stalkers use the same tactics regarding light and detected small magic items as their dark creeper brethren if they have the opportunity, and suffer the same AC penalty as well.

Dark stalkers carry their treasure in their robes like dark creepers: 30% chance of magic short sword, 10% of magical rings (worn if possible), 10% chance of either 2d4 gems or 1d2 items of jewellery to be determined randomly by GM.

When a dark stalker dies, it explodes in a sickly blue 3d8 _fireball_ blast. Magic items carried by the stalker have a 75% chance of surviving the blast in usable condition.

The disenchanter resembles a rather bizarre cross between a dromedary camel and a cow, with a muscular prehensile snout stuck on for good measure. Colouration is a shimmery electric blue and the entire creature appears to be somewhat translucent and difficult for the eye to focus upon.

The disenchanter is a thaumivore, feeding on magical power. It sucks the dweomer from enchanted objects by attaching its snout to them with a successful “to hit” roll. One touch is all it takes to render any magic item (except major artifacts) completely inert. The creature has no other attacks and causes no physical damage of any kind. The muscular snout can be extended as much as 5-ft and the disenchanter is capable of detecting relative strengths of magic enchantment, knowing, for instance, that _**plate mail +5**_ will be a tastier morsel than a mere _**+1 ring of protection**_.

The disenchanter can only be hit by magic weapons but doing so will not affect the dweomer of the weapon; only the snout has the ability to disenchant items. Even the wisest and most learned of sages know nothing about the ecology of the disenchanter or why it seems to be able to sustain itself only with magic items.

Doppelgängers are strange beings that are able to take on the forms of those they encounter, including the appearance of equipment and any clothing the victim is wearing. A doppelgänger can assume any humanoid form between 4-ft to 8-ft tall, but the creature must first see the victim to be copied. Any doppelgänger's attempt at physical disguise is only faulty 10% of the time, and its knowledge of the victim is facilitated by the doppelgänger's innate ESP ability. In its natural form, a doppelgänger is a 5-ft to 6-ft tall humanoid, slender with gangly limbs and half-formed features. Its flesh is pale and hairless, and its large, bulging eyes are yellow with slitted pupils. The creature will assume its natural form upon death.

Doppelgängers make excellent use of their natural mimicry to stage ambushes, bait traps, and infiltrate society. Their classic tactic in a dungeon is to take the form of a member of an adventuring party, dispatch him or her, and take his or her place amongst the group until a good time presents itself to kill them or rob them.

Doppelgängers save as 10th level fighters, and are immune to the effects of _charm_ and _sleep_ spells.

_Treasure:_ 1d10×1,000 cp (5%), 1d12×1,000 sp (25%), 1d6×1,000 ep (25%), 1d8×1,000 gp (25%), 1d12 gems (15%), 1d8 jewellery (10%), 1 scroll and any 3 magic items (25%)

Dracolisks are surmised to be the result of the mating of a black dragon and a basilisk, though rumours persist of the existence of other sorts. These fearsome creatures most resemble their draconic sires, being armoured with thick black scales and having the horns and sharp toothed maws of their forebears; they also have six powerful clawed limbs and two large wings. If a dracolisk speaks a language at all, it is usually draconic, though it may be that some can understand other languages.

Although capable of flight, dracolisks are limited to only short durations, ten or twenty minutes at the most, before they have to rest, so they principally use this form of movement to swoop down upon or escape from foes. In physical combat, dracolisks bite for 3d4 damage and strike for 1d6 damage with their two forelimbs. However, they are more likely to use their breath weapon or gaze attack before entering melee. Up to thrice a day, a dracolisk is capable of shooting an acid stream out of its mouth up to 30-ft and with a width of 5-ft; this causes 4d6 damage to anybody caught in its path, though a successful saving throw vs breath weapons reduces this by half. Additionally, anybody unfortunate enough to be within 30-ft of a dracolisk and meet its gaze must make a saving throw vs petrifaction or be turned to stone. As with its basilisk parent, the gaze attack of the dracolisk extends into the astral and ethereal planes and those who seek to avoid looking directly at the beast attack with a -4 penalty.

_Treasure:_ 1d10×1,000 cp (25%), 1d8×1,000 sp (25%), 1d6×1,000 gp (25%), 1d6×100 pp (25%), 3d6 gems (50%), 3d4 jewellery (50%) and any three magic items (25%)

Dragon turtles are not true dragons, but seem to be a blend of the same kind that produced the owlbear. They do resemble true dragons in that they have a breath weapon: a cloud of steam 60 ft long, 40 ft wide and 40 ft high. The steam does damage equal to the dragon turtle’s remaining hp (save for half damage) to all within the cloud.

A dragon turtle surfacing beneath a vessel will capsize it 90% of the time (even if it is a very large vessel such as a galley).

**Air Elementals** are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air, though they may sometimes be found elsewhere. When encountered on the Prime Material Plane, usually as a result of summoning magic, they take the form of billowing clouds of vapour or dust. Whilst they may understand what is said to them, they rarely respond in kind and their language is that of the wind.

Their primary attack form is a stream of air that they use like an invisible limb to strike for 2d20 damage. Its great airborne speed makes it a swift and formidable opponent, especially in aerial combat where it gains +1 “to hit” and +4 to damage.

Air Elementals may also use a whirlwind attack if so commanded. To do this, the Air Elemental must assume the form of a small cyclone, which takes one turn. Typically, this appears to be 30-ft in diameter at the top and funnels down to 10-ft in diameter at its base; the cone extends 20-ft in height for every 4 HD the elemental possesses. This whirlwind attack lasts for only one round, but any creatures with less than 3 hit dice that find themselves within it are slain; creatures with 3 HD or more take 2d8 damage. Should the cyclone for some reason be unable to reach its full height, only creatures with less than 2HD will suffer immediate death, whilst all others take only 1d8 damage.

**Earth Elementals** are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth, though they may sometimes be found elsewhere. When encountered on the Prime Material Plane, usually as a result of summoning magic, they seem to be vaguely humanoid mounds of stone, earth, metal and crystal. Whilst they may have a discernible head and face, it is usually devoid of expression and they will not speak, their language being the rumblings of the earth.

What Earth Elementals lack in speed, they make up for in relentless determination and dedication. They pass through rock and earth without hindrance, as they do along the ground, but they cannot travel through the air nor in or over water unless they remain in contact with the earth.

Earth Elementals prefer to fight enemies on the ground and will almost always seek a way to do so, as when they strike opponents who are also in contact with the earth their great limbs strike for 4d8 points of damage; against foes who are not in contact with ground, the Earth Elemental strikes for only 4d6 points of damage.

The power of Earth Elementals against ground built structures and fortifications is truly devastating; they are capable of reducing small structures to rubble in a matter of minutes and even the largest will eventually collapse if the Elemental is free to work against it.

**Fire Elementals** are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire, though they may sometimes be found elsewhere. When encountered on the Prime Material Plane, usually as a result of summoning magic, they take the form of a great flickering sheet of flame, which occasionally seems to have a somewhat humanoid shape. Though they can apparently understand what is said to them, they do not usually respond in kind, their language being heard only in the dull roar of burning fire.

Although Fire Elementals themselves travel at a fairly normal speed, the same cannot be said about the fires they are capable of starting. Indeed, those unlucky enough to be struck by a fiery appendage not only suffer 3d8 points of damage, but any combustible items exposed will be set alight if they fail a saving throw against magical fire, which is subject to a -2 penalty.

Fire Elementals may not travel across or enter non-flammable liquids; they cannot, for instance, cross broad rivers without the aid of a bridge or a similar contrivance, though they can leap narrow streams. Creatures capable of innately controlling or otherwise making use of fire are somewhat resistant to the Fire Elementals, taking only 3d6 points of damage if struck by one.

**Water Elementals** are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Water, though they may sometimes be found elsewhere. When encountered on the Prime Material Plane, usually as a result of summoning magic, they take the form of a great wave of water or other liquid, constantly in motion, but retaining an almost humanoid shape. Some claim that they have sea green eyes, of a sort, and others that they were able to discern a mouth. Like others of its kind, though, it rarely responds in kind when spoken to, its language being heard only in the crash of waves.

While Water Elementals can fight on land, they prefer to be surrounded by as much liquid as possible, which greatly increases their speed and allows them to effectively disappear from sight whenever they wish. In such an environment they strike opponents with a great watery limb for 5d6 points of damage.

Water Elementals forced to fight on land cannot do so more than sixty yards from the place at which they entered the plane they are currently on, which on the Prime Material Plane is generally the place of summoning. Additionally, when fighting on land they strike opponents for only 5d4 points of damage.

Ships are particularly vulnerable to Water Elementals; they are capable of overturning any vessel with a tonnage equal to or less than their HD and of stopping those with a tonnage equal or less than the Water Elemental's hit points. Ships with a greater tonnage than the Elemental has hp total travel at 1% of their speed for each point by which they exceed it.

_Treasure:_ None (for all elementals)

Ettercaps appear to be humanoid arachnids. Their bite is venomous and they can spin silk from their short, stubby tails like a spider does. An ettercap will use this silk to prepare traps around its lair, such as webs and tripwires, and may use a silk-based weapon such as a lassoo or garrotte.

A small, weird monster that may be related to the lurker above, the executioner's hood often dwells underground or in ruins. It drops from niches, cracks or anchor-points on the ceiling onto its victim's head and begins to strangle. If its first attack is successful, the creature will hit automatically each round thereafter, inflicting rolled damage (1d4 hp).

Because the executioner's hood actually surrounds its victim's head, any attack affecting the creature will also affect its victim.

The only known ways to remove an executioner's hood are to kill it or to bathe it in alcohol, which will intoxicate it until it becomes flaccid and helpless.

The eye of the deep is globular in shape (about 4-ft in diameter) and has a massive central eye. Two further eyes on stalks sprout from the top of the monster, two huge lobster-like pincers emerge from the side, and it has a gaping maw below. Each eye has a unique power: the central eye can fire a cone 30-ft long and 20-ft in diameter at the base that stuns all within the area of effect for 2d4 rounds (save vs aimed magic items to avoid the effect), while the left and right eyestalks can cast _hold monster_ and _hold person_ respectively, once each per round, at will. The two eyestalks together can cast _phantasmal force_ once per round, at will, if not used to cast _hold_ spells.

Giant flies are more massive than the normal variety of flying insects and thus are Aerial Agility: Level III, though they can hover. They do retain a normal fly's ability to react quickly and thus they can jump away from an attack in only 1 segment. This jumping defensive move is a backward springing leap which carries the giant fly 30-ft away and does not count as a retreat for purposes of a free attack.

**Blow Fly, Giant:** These flies will rarely attack living prey unless he or she is covered with blood or has open wounds. They are also attracted to sweet food and drink, an abundance of these might garner the attention of this monster. Giant flies are more often encountered wherever there is an abundance of their preferred diet: carrion, rotting food, and malodorous refuse. The bite of a giant blow fly has a 10% chance of infecting the victim with disease. Giant blow flies have a shiny metallic green or blue body covered with coarse black hair. Their large eyes are a dark orange colour.

**Horsefly, Giant:** This giant insect is even larger than the giant blow fly and far more aggressive. The giant horsefly dines on fresh blood and it will land on any warm-blooded creature is encounters, attempting to draw blood from the target with its bite. The round after a successful biting attack the horsefly inflicts the same amount of damage upon the victim again as it draws blood from the bite wound inflicted on the victim. This process can be halted by either killing or driving the giant horsefly away. Giant horseflies are flat tan and brown in colour, with shiny brown eyes.

_Treasure:_ None (for all giant flies)

Violet fungi looks like shriekers and in fact the two are often found growing together. The plants are usually 4-ft to 7-ft tall, and each plant has 1d4 branches growing out if it. At 4-ft tall, the fungi will have 1-ft branches. For every foot taller the fungi grows, the branches grow a foot longer. When the fungi detects movement nearby it will wave its branches around releasing its spores. Anyone within 4-ft will have to save vs poison or their exposed flesh will begin to rot within 1 round. Anyone who fails their save will require a _cure disease_ spell.

Gargoyles are cruel creatures, 90% likely to attack any living creature they encounter. When attacking a gargoyle will employ two clawed hands, a single horn projecting from the centre of its forehead and a bite. They are usually encountered in ruins and underground caverns.

Gelatinous cubes are dungeon scavengers. They move slowly through corridors and rooms, absorbing carrion, fungi, algae and other nutrients from the surfaces they touch.

Being silent and virtually transparent, gelatinous cubes have a higher-than-usual chance to surprise (1-3 on 1d6).

Gelatinous cubes can only digest organic material, and they will sometimes sweep up inorganic substances (including metal items such as coins, glass or ceramic items such as potion bottles, etc.). These incidental items are sometimes kept in the body of the 'cube for many days before being ejected. Such items form the creature's treasure.

The touch of a gelatinous cube causes paralysis for 3d6+2 rounds (a saving throw vs paralysation is permitted to avoid this effect).

Gelatinous cubes are immune to electricity, _fear_, _sleep_, _hold_, _paralysis_, and _polymorph_. Cold-based attacks _slow_ them (as the spell) and inflict a maximum of 1d4 damage, unless they save in which case the cold based attack will have no effect. They have standard resistance to other forms of magic such as fire.

_Treasure:_ Incidental; see creature description

Genies come from the Elemental Plane of Air and are quite magical. They can travel the elemental planes and the Astral Plane, as well as the Prime Material. If subdued they can be enslaved for 1,001 days. Once their service has expired they are free and may not become enslaved again by the same creature.

Genies can perform any of the following abilities once per day: create food for up to 12 people; create water or wine for up to 12 people; create up to 16 cubic-ft of cloth, 9 cubic-ft of wood, or 100 lbs of metal (the metal is not permanent and will disappear within a day); create an illusion with both sight and sound that will act on its own without being controlled. The illusion will last until it is dispelled or touched. Genies can become invisible or gaseous at will. They can also walk on the wind. Genies can assume the form of a whirlwind 7-ft tall, 3-ft across at the top, and 1-ft across at the bottom. This lasts for an entire round and does 2d6 hit points of damage to all creatures caught in its path. Any creature with less then 2 hit dice are killed instantly. If any air-based attack is performed on the genie, it will be at -1 “to hit” and -1 to damage.

A genie can carry up to 600 lbs without tiring, either flying or walking. A genie is able to carry double the weight on foot but only for about thirty minutes. A genie will require an hour's rest for every 30 minutes of carrying.

A noble genie has 10d8 hit dice, does 3d8 damage, and their whirlwind does 3d6 damage. Besides their normal abilities a noble genie is also able to grant three wishes. If subdued a noble genie need only grant three _wishes_ to be released from service.

Genies have their own language but they also have a limited form of telepathy that enables them to communicate with any intelligent creature.

Like giant bulls with thick metal scales, gorgons are magical creatures capable of breathing a cloud of petrifying gas in a cone 60-ft long and 10-ft in radius at the base up to 3 times per day. They will usually (85%) use this attack form in preference to hitting with their horns.

_Treasure:_ (In lair only) 1d8×1,000 cp (10%), 1d12×1,000 sp (25%), 1d6×1,000 ep (25%), 1d8×1,000 gp (25%), 1d10 gems (15%), 1d8 jewellery (10%), any four magic items (25%)

Grey ooze is indistinguishable from wet stone until it attacks. It will form tentacles that lash out at any who pass. It is corrosive and will eat through chain in 1 round, 2 rounds to eat through plate. It will not damage wood or stone. Magic involving heat or cold does not harm grey ooze but lightning will. Grey ooze also takes full damage from normal weapons, but if the weapon is made of metal it too will begin to dissolve.

As it matures grey ooze gets larger. Specimens over 20 HP can be as large as 36 square-ft. While they cover a huge area they are never more then a few inches deep. At larger sizes they begin to form a kind of consciousness.

Griffons build nests on cliff faces and rocky outcrops. Where possible they even have been known to build nests inside shallow caves. Horses are their favourite meal and being the fearsome hunters they are, griffons will usually attack their prey on sight.

Hatchlings are particularly valuable as they can be trained as mounts. This takes time, effort, and money. The training takes years and must begin early in a griffon's life. Once the griffon reaches maturity there is no chance of training it.

When ridden by a creature weighing more than 100 lbs, a griffon's aerial agility decreases to III.

_Treasure:_ 1d12×1,000 cp (20%), 1d6×1,000 sp (30%), 1d4×1,000 ep (10%), 1d6 gems (25%), 1d3 jewellery (20%), 2 magic items (10%), 2d4 potions (40%)

These nasty creatures are part vulture and part woman. They emit a pleasant-sounding call and all who hear it must save vs magic or be drawn to the source. Once there, the touch of a harpy will charm the victim unless they save vs magic. When the victim is helpless, the harpies will torture, kill, and consume her prey. In combat a harpy attacks with her clawed feet and, usually, some kind of club as a melee weapon. Most harpies speak only their own language.

_Treasure:_ 1d12×1,000 cp (20%), 1d6×1,000 sp (30%), 1d4×1,000 ep (10%), 1d6 gems (25%), 1d3 jewellery (20%), any 2 magic items (10%).

Hell hounds are not native to the material plane; they are brought here by others to serve as guard dogs. These beasts have their normal bite but they can also breath fire up to 10-ft. Their breath's damage equals in hit points their hit dice. Thus a 6 hit dice hell hound breathes fire that does 6hp damage, unless the opponent saves vs breath weapons for half damage.

Because hell hounds can move so quietly they surprise on a roll of 1-4. They can only be surprised on a roll of 1 due to their own sharp senses. Their own vision is so sharp that 50% of the time they can spot hidden or invisible creatures. These fiendish dogs are dark reddish in colour with glowing red eyes and black mouths.

Hippogriffs can only be found in remote locations far from civilisation. They make their nests on rocky outcrops and cliff faces. Even though hippogriffs are omnivorous they do not mix well other winged beasts. If encountered near its nest, a hippogriff will fight ferociously to defend itself and its young. Eggs and hatchlings bring a high price from those wishing to train them as mounts.

When ridden by a creature weighing more than 100 lbs, a hippogriff's aerial agility rating decreases to III.

**Homonculus**

A homonculus is a small construct that is vaguely humanoid in form, stands about 18-in tall, and has bat-like wings with a 24-in wingspan. Homonculi have greenish reptilian skin, a bat-like head and ears, and a mouth full of needle sharp teeth. The bite of a homonculus is venomous and causes a comatose state for 1d6×5 (5-30) minutes unless the victim saves vs magic to negate. A homonculus is a reflection of its magic user creator and therefore rolls saves at whatever level its owner makes his saving throws. Magical defences in effect upon the owner, _resist fire_ or _bless_ for example, also protect the homonculus.

Similarly, its alignment is the same as its creator's alignment. A homonculus cannot speak, but knows what its creator knows, and can communicate what it sees and hears to its creator via a limited form of telepathy up to 500-ft away. A homonculus will never willingly exceed the maximum communication range. The homonculus is completely under control of its creator, who need not concentrate on control to maintain it. This means the homonculus can be given a specific goal, which it will then plan to achieve, carrying out its orders without further attention from its creator.

Homonculi make excellent messengers, scouts, or spies. A homonculus can either walk upright like a human or fly, as need dictates. It is very quick and agile in combat, darting in and out of melee to deliver its venomous bite. Killing a homonculus deals an immediate 2d10 points of damage to its master. If the owner of the homonculus dies, the homonculus immediately disappears in a puff of smoke. Since Homonculi are constructs and not natural creatures they are never encountered in the wild.

Homonculi are created in a process involving both the spell caster and the services of an alchemist. The alchemist will require 1d4×500 (500-2,000) gold pieces, a pint of the magic user's blood, and 1d4 weeks to prepare the base mixture of fluids which will form the creature. Within 24 hours of the alchemist completing the mixture process the magic user must cast the following spells upon the fluid, in order: mending, mirror image, and wizard eye. The spells must be cast by the person who gave the blood for the basic mixture (though scrolls may be used). Failure to cast the spells within 24 hours or casting the required spells out of order ruins that mixture and the whole process and all costs must be repeated. Upon completion of the wizard eye spell the fluid coalesces into a ready-to-use homonculus.

Treasure: None.

A hydra is a multi-headed reptilian monster that lives in damp, dark places like swamps, bogs, or marshes. Sometimes they are found underground if the lair is sufficiently dank and wet.

Hydras have reptilian bodies, four legs, a tail and 1d12+4 heads. Each head counts as 1 hit die and has 8 full hit points, so a 10 headed hydra will have 10 hit die and 80 hp. Each head can attack independently or up to four heads can attack a single target. The damage a hydra does is based on the number of heads. A hydra with 5 or 6 heads is considered small and does 1d6 points of damage. One with 7 to 10 heads is considered medium and does 1d8 points of damage. One with 11 or 12 heads is considered large and does 1d10 points of damage, and one with 13 to 16 heads is considered huge and does 1d12 damage.

The colouration of a hydra ranges from light brown to an almost blackish brown with a yellow or tan underbelly. Their eyes range from yellow to orange.

A denizen of the Elemental Plane of Air, an invisible stalker encountered on the Prime Material Plane has been conjured and bound to service by a magic user. The summoning mage retains command of the creature until it either fulfils the mission which it was summoned to perform or it is killed.

While on the Prime Material Plane invisible stalkers can only be viewed by magical means (e.g. _**gem of seeing**_, _true seeing_, _detect invisibility_); otherwise anyone attacking an invisible stalker suffers a -2 penalty “to hit”. An invisible stalker cannot be killed on this plane. Reducing it to zero hit points merely banishes it back to its home plane for a period of 1 year plus 1 day.

Invisible stalkers are useful, if dangerous, servants. Once given a mission they will relentlessly pursue their goal, motivated more by a dislike of forced service and a desire to return to their home plane than by any sense of devotion to their summoner. Invisible stalkers are faultless trackers across any surface or distance and, if ordered to kill their prey, will attack without checking morale until either they or their target is dead. As implied above, invisible stalkers are not willing servants but will not normally begrudge performing a simple task of short duration for the summoner.

More complicated tasks or tasks of duration longer than a week will anger the invisible stalker and may lead it to attempt to pervert the wording of its commands without directly violating them. If ordered to guard the summoner's treasure in perpetuity, for instance, the invisible stalker might remove every last copper piece of the summoner's treasure to a secret vault located within the invisible stalker's lair on the Elemental Plane of Air, where the 'stalker could easily keep watch over it.

If the GM feels the invisible stalker's service too onerous or complicated, he or she should assign a cumulative 1% per day chance of the 'stalker wearying of its task and attempting to twist the meaning its orders. A clever summoner might be able to word his or her orders in such a way as to make its meaning airtight and clear. In this case the 'stalker must continue to serve until its duties are discharged.

Invisible stalkers can understand the common tongue of the Prime Material Plane, the language of the Elemental Plane of Air, and their own language. They will speak no tongue but their own.

A jackalwere is a malevolent beast who can assume human form (and hence not a lycanthrope, since lycanthropes are men who can assume animal form). They will mingle with people, choosing easy targets to victimise. Living for the thrill of murder, many times they will consume the remains of their prey. Often they steal the victims' possessions, assume their identities, and go on to the next town. A jackalwere often uses their gaze attack, those who fail their save vs spell will fall into a deep sleep, to immobilise their prey. During melee a jackalwere will most often attack with a weapon. These foul beasts are immune to normal weapons, they must be attacked with iron or magical weapons. Jackalweres sometimes prefer the company of normal jackals and rarely can be found living among them.

It is rumoured kraken once lived in shallower coastal waters and had armies of slaves who worshipped them. For some reason they were forced to retreat to the deepest depths of the oceans. In the darkness they grew larger and more powerful. They excavated huge labyrinths in the sea floor. Now they prey on ships for food and slaves which they drag down to their watery dungeons. A kraken will attack a ship in the same way a giant squid does, by anchoring itself with 2 arms and attacking with the other 8. If the kraken wraps 6 tentacles around a ship and squeezes for 3 consecutive rounds, it will cause enough damage to sink the ship.

A kraken's body is protected by a tough shell (AC 0), but its tentacles and head are more vulnerable (AC 5). Two tentacles are covered with barbs and do 2d6 damage. The other 6 tentacles hit for 2d4 damage. With each successful hit the kraken grabs its victim and holds it. With each successive round the tentacle does an additional 3d4 crushing damage. The kraken's sharp beak bites for 5d4 damage. Once held, the only way to get free is to sever the tentacle by causing 16 hp damage to it.

Those within the tentacle's grasp are 25% likely to have both arms held, and as such they are helpless. Most of the time (50%) they will have one limb held and are able to attack with a -3 penalty. The other 25% of the time the victim will both arms free and can attack the squid with only a -1 penalty.

If the kraken looses more then 3 arms it will release the ship and flee. As it does the monster will release ink in the water leaving a cloud 80-ft deep by 80-ft wide by 120-ft long. A kraken's ink is poisonous and will cause 1d4 points of damage per round until the ink dissipates. The ink lasts for about 5 rounds.

They also have following spell-like abilities. A kraken is able to create a sphere of _airy water_ 240-ft across once per day, create _faerie fire_ for 8 hours, _control temperature_ (40-ft), _control winds_, and _weather summoning_ once each per day. Three times a day they can cast _animal_ (fish) _summoning III_ which gives them the ability to summon the fish but not control them.

_Treasure:_ 12d4×1,000 gp (50%), 1d8×1,000 pp (50%), 9d6 gems (55%), 2d10 jewellery (45%), 4 magic items+1d6 scrolls+2d4 potions (50%)

Lamiai like to live in deserted towns, ruins, and other desolate places. These creatures have the upper body of a woman and the lower half of an animal.

Typically a lamia is armed with a dagger, but these are really just tools. Lamiai are able to cast these spells once per day: _charm person_, _mirror image_, _suggestion_, and _illusion_ (like the wand). They use these spells to lure their victims and then hold them. The touch of a lamia permanently drains a single point of wisdom; once their victim's wisdom falls below 3 they will do as the lamia instructs. The lamiai like to drain their victims' blood, then devour their flesh. They speak the common language.

Champions of all that is good and just, lammasu have quadrupedal bodies the size and shape of the largest of lions, fully-functional feathered wings, and a human head bearing the kindly visage of a bearded wise man.

Lammasu are the guardians and protectors of all lawful good persons and have a friendly disposition to all good-aligned creatures they encounter. Lammasu tend to lair in warm climates but travel widely and can thus be encountered anywhere.

Lammasu prefer to advise and support the forces of good if at all possible but are formidable opponents in battle. In fact, it is almost impossible to press a lammasu into combat against its will due to its ability to dimension door and become invisible at will. In combat lammasu claw with their two powerful front legs for 1d6+1 points of damage apiece, and they also defend themselves with a variety of spells and spell-like abilities.

Lammasu are constantly surrounded by an extra strength protection from evil, 10-ft radius (-2 to attack, +2 on saving throws from attacking evil creatures) and can cast cleric spells of up to 4th level as an 8th level cleric does. Spell list: 4—1st level, 3—2nd level, 2—3rd level, 1—4th level. Lammasu cast _cure light wounds_ and _cure serious wounds_ at double normal efficacy (2d8 hp and 4d8+2 hp respectively). 20% of these creatures can also speak a _holy word_ at will.

When flying, they can use their claw attacks if forced into battle. They are difficult to hit in return because they can _dimension door_ at any time away from an flying opponent's path of attack.

Lammasu can communicate in their own tongue, the alignment language of lawful good creatures, and also through telepathy.

Fire lizards are also known as “false dragons” and are thought to be an evolutionary dead-end on the dragon family tree. These giant lizards have a tough scaled hide very similar to a dragon but lacking the long life, wings, and horns of their fire-breathing cousins. Colouration tends to be a rather neutral grey with patches of a dark brownish red on the dorsal surface, and a lighter red on the ventral surface. Fire lizards darken in colour as they age. Curiously, red dragons avoid confrontation with fire lizards and will not even lair in the same area fire lizards frequent.

False dragons are normally slow-moving creatures and spend 50% their time sleeping in their subterranean lairs. When they emerge every two weeks or so to feed, however, they are aggressive foes.

In combat a fire lizard will attack with two raking attacks from its front legs followed by a bite attack. It also has a breath weapon it can use at will, a cone shaped gout of flame 10-ft wide at the terminus with a range of 150-ft, causing 2d6 points of damage. A saving throw vs breath weapons is allowed for half damage.

Fire lizards have an affinity for shiny objects and their lairs tend be littered with coins and gems. A lair also has a 15% chance of containing 1d6 eggs, but the fire lizard is largely indifferent as to their fate. The first hatchling will generally eat the others as they emerge. A fire lizard egg can fetch as much as 5,000 gp from an interested party.

_Treasure:_ None carried. In lair: 1d8×1,000 cp (45%), 1d6×1,000 sp (30%), 1d6×1,000 ep (25%), 1d4×1,000 gp (33%), 1d4×100 pp (10%), 2d4 gems (30%), 1d6 jewellery (20%), Magic Sword/Armour/Weapon (12%), 2d4 potions (50%), 1d6 scrolls (40%)

Giant Lizards dwell in marshy or swampy areas. On a hit of 20 a giant lizard has grabbed its opponent firmly in its powerful jaws and will cause double damage that round. Giant lizards are otherwise unremarkable beasts.

_Treasure:_ None

**Monitor Lizards** (also known as “Komodo lizards,” though none can remember why) are aggressive carnivores found in warm regions. Their colouration tends toward dark grey and black and they have longer snouts and longer, sharper teeth than other types of giant lizards. Monitor lizards move slowly but can lunge rather suddenly, surprising their prey on a 1d4. On a hit of 20, in addition to the damage the attack causes, the monitor has seized its opponent in its toothy maw and the unfortunate victim is subjected to an automatic attack the following round.

_Treasure:_ In lair: 4d6 cp (90%), 3d6 sp (80%), 3d6 ep (70%), 2d6 gp (60%), 1d6 pp (50%), 2d6 gems (40%), 1d2 magic items (10%)

**Cave Lizards** dwell in underground settings such as caverns and dungeons. A cave lizard's colouration allows it to blend with its surroundings and the cave lizard is capable of running on the walls or even on the ceiling at its full movement rate. On a natural hit of 20 its jaws have clamped onto its prey, causing double damage on that attack. In combat a cave lizard will attempt to drag a clamped victim to its lair and devour it.

Locathah are aquatic nomads who make their home in the warm, shallow, salt waters of seas and oceans. They roam the area around their lair, hunting and gathering food. They are rather distrustful of strangers, even strangers of their own species.

Locathah troops are organised into companies of 40 warriors, led by a war-chief with 22 hit points who fights as a 5th level fighter. The war-chief is assisted by 4 sub-chiefs with 15 hp who fight as 3rd level fighters. Any group of 4 or more companies (120 warriors) will be led by a full chief with 30 hp who fights as a 6th level fighter. The chief will be protected by his honour guard of 12 warriors who fight as sub-chiefs. There is a 5% chance a sub-chief or war-chief will be carrying a magic weapon of the appropriate type and a 10% a full chief will have one.

Locathah troops ride giant eels (q.v.) into battle and these mounts will also fight. Locathah troops typically have a roughly equal chance to be armed with: lance, trident, spear gun and dagger, or, net and dagger. Spear guns are treated as light crossbows with a 20-ft range underwater and as a normal light crossbow if used on the surface.

These nomads lair in undersea rocks very much like human fortifications, and will often alter the rock face to a distinctive fortress-like appearance. The locathah will hollow the rock into rooms, chambers, and passages as needed and doors are typically quite sturdy and well guarded either by moray eels or trapped air bubbles containing Portuguese man-o-wars.

_Description:_ Locathah are man-sized humanoids covered in scales. They have large, fish-like black eyes and large fan-shaped finned ears. Locathah colouration is greenish-yellow, lightening to a pale yellow on their ventral surfaces and darkening toward the crest, which runs from the top of their head to the base of the stubby tails. Locathah can leave the water for short periods (2d10 minutes) of time but are loath to do so.

_Treasure:_ None carried. In lair: 1d4×1,000 cp (30%), 1d6×1,000 sp (20%), 1d8×1,000 ep (30%), 1d10×1,000 gp (40%), 1d6×100 pp (25%), 3d12 gems (65%), 4d10 jewellery (50%), 3 random magic sword/armour/misc. magic item (33%)

Lurkers are dangerous creatures that wait in high places for prey to pass beneath them; in shape they are said to resemble manta rays, but have such colouration and form that they can become almost indistinguishable from the stone of the caverns in which they dwell.

It is very difficult to spot Lurkers ahead of time. Perhaps as few as one in ten are observed, even after considerable effort is made to discover them. As long as they remain undiscovered, they have a +4 bonus to their chance of surprise, attacking by dropping onto a creature. Lurkers that successfully engulf their victim automatically cause 1d6 points of damage from constriction every round and will cause suffocation within 2-5 minutes. Those engulfed may only use short weapons against their attacker and are not in a position to draw additional arms. Lurkers continue to attack until slain and are very difficult to escape.

Dark, dank caves or desolate underground caverns are the favoured lair of the manticore. These fearsome beasts are man-eaters. Their favourite tactic is to launch 6 iron spikes from their tail that act like crossbow bolts. They can do this up to 4 times before they run out. Once they have their prey in a weakened condition they use their claws to finish the job.

A manticore has a lion's body with a human head and bat-like wings. Its tail is thick and club-like at the end, and bristles with iron spikes.

Medusæ resemble the similarly-named monster from Greek myth. They can bite with their snaky hair, inflicting the damage noted, in which case their target must save vs poison or die, but their more feared attack mode is their gaze, which petrifies any creature that looks into their eyes. The creature may attempt a save vs petrifaction to avoid this. One of the most effective weapons against a medusa is a mirror, for a medusa that sees her own reflection may be petrified herself if she fails her save.

A character attempting to fight a medusa without looking at her must accept a penalty of -4 on his or her “to hit” rolls.

Note that a medusa's gaze extends into nearby planes of existence, such as the ætheral or astral planes, and has full effect there.

_Treasure:_ 1d6×1,000 sp (30%), 1d2×1,000 ep (25%), 2d6×1,000 gp (70%), 10d4 gems (50%), 1 misc magic + 1 potion (60%)

Mephits are the varlets, lackeys, messengers, errand runners, and fetchers of the Lower Planes. They can be found in any of the evilly-aligned lower planes and will be serving the various demons, devils, evil elemental gods, or any extra-planar creature of dark purpose and evil intent. Their exact origins and home plane are not known; even the mephits themselves do not know for certain. This entry lists the known types of mephits, but dark rumours persist of other types more dangerous than these.

Mephits share various common characteristics. They are all about 5-ft tall, bat-winged, with sharp fangs. Mephits speak their own language shared by all the different types of mephits, their alignment tongue, and usually speak the common tongue of whatever lower plane they happen

to call home. Mephits are mischievous and have a malignant sense of humour, finding joy in the pain of others. Mephits love to dress in outlandish clothing, choosing colours and designs that clash and draw attention. They are often found smoking an infernal cigar that gives off an offensive odour. Mephits love to strut about as they smoke, shrieking in shrill voices in their harsh tongue.

**Fire Mephit:** These creatures are a dull red colour with spots of black on the dorsal surfaces and a slightly lighter red on the ventral surface. Fire mephits are wreathed with tiny wisps of flame and touching one bare-handed will cause 1 point of damage. In combat mephits attack with two claws and a breath weapon. Though damage for claw attacks is listed as 1d3 points apiece, an additional 1 point of heat damage is also inflicted upon non fire-resistant opponents for a total of 2-4 points of damage per claw.

The fire mephit's breath weapon has two modes: a jet of flame 15-ft long and 1 in wide, or a blanket of flame 5-ft square. The jet is directed against a single target and always hits, causing 1d8+1 hp; a saving throw vs breath weapons is allowed for half damage. The blanket of flame causes 4 points of damage to each victim in the area of effect, no saving throw allowed.

Fire mephits also have spell-like abilities and are able to cast magic missile (two missiles) and heat metal once each per day. The fire mephit may also gate in a mephit ally, type determined randomly, once per hour with a 33% chance of success.

**Lava Mephit:** These mephits are red in colour and sweat droplets of molten lava. As a result, the lava mephit is so hot it can be sensed up to 30-ft away. Touching one without protection results in 1d8 points of damage.

In combat lava mephits claw for 1 point of damage, plus the 1d8 points of heat damage to any opponent not protected against fire or heat damage. Every 3 rounds lava mephits can spit a blob of molten lava as a breath weapon, up to 8 times before recharging (see below). The projectile has a 10-ft range, always hits the mephit's target, and inflicts 1d6 hp with no saving throw.

When in contact with molten lava the lava mephit can regenerate 2 hp per round, but if killed it cannot regenerate back to life as a troll does. Contact with lava also allows the mephit to recharge its breath weapon.

The touch of a lava mephit dissolves metal rather quickly, destroying plate mail armour in 3 melee rounds. Wood is dissolves a little more slowly, about an inch per hour of contact. The lava mephit can shape-change into a pool of lava but doing so will not recharge the mephit's breath weapon or allow it to regenerate. Lava mephits can _gate_ in 1d2 mephits once per hour with a 25% chance of success. There is an equal chance of gating in any type of mephit but if two are gated they will be the same type.

**Smoke Mephit:** This type of mephit is black in colour and constantly emits smoke from its body. When encountered on the Prime Material Plane this mephit will rarely stray from dark or smoky areas except in great need.

In combat, these mephits strike with two claws for 1d2 points of damage and may employ their breath weapon every other round. The smoke mephit's breath weapon is a ball of oily smoke that automatically strikes its target, with a range of 20-ft and dealing 1d4 hp, no save allowed. In addition to the hit point damage, the victim is blinded for 1d2 rounds. There is no limit to the number of times a smoke mephit may use its breath weapon.

Smoke mephits also have the spell-like abilities once each per day of _invisibility_ and _dancing lights_. Smoke mephits can also _gate_ in 1d2 mephits once per hour with a 25% chance of success. There is an equal chance of gating in any type of mephit but if two are gated they will be the same type.

If slain, the smoke mephit emits a burst of flash-fire which inflicts 1 point of damage to everyone with 10-ft, no saving throw allowed.

**Steam Mephit:** These mephits are grey and constantly sweat hot water in profuse amounts, leaving puddles of hot water behind them as they travel. Touching a steam mephit will cause 1 point of damage to unprotected skin and has a 50% chance of stunning the victim for 1 melee round.

In battle, a steam mephit will attack with two claws for 1d4 points of damage each. The steam mephit has a breath weapon of scalding water that will automatically hit any target within 20-ft for 1d3 points of damage and having a 50% chance of stunning the target, no saving throw allowed. The mephit can use this breath weapon every other round an unlimited number of times.

The steam mephit also has several spell-like abilities. Once per day it can rain boiling water in 40×40-ft square area of effect for 2d6 hp to each target in the affected area, no saving throw. Once per hour the steam mephit can contaminate water (as the reverse of the _purify water_ spell). Once per hour the steam mephit can attempt to _gate_, with a 30% chance of success, 1d2 mephits. There is an equal chance of gating in any of the four types of mephits but if 2 appear they will both be the same type.

_Treasure:_ 3d12 pp per individual (for all mephits)

Mermen, or more properly “merfolk” according to the sages, are the inhabitants of oceans and seas in the warmer areas of the world being particularly fond of tropical seas. Mermen are much like rural humans, farming and harvesting vegetation on the ocean floor and hunting in the area around their settlements; they hunt for fish and other sea-going creatures. Merfolk have been known to herd certain fish, keeping them corralled in large, spherical netted seaweed pens in much the same way their human counterparts will herd cattle.

Merfolk tend to congregate in small communities, establishing their dwellings in reefs or underwater cliffs and tunnelling many rooms and passages into these natural structures. Rarely, mermen will construct dwellings of natural materials such as seashells, coral, rocks, and materials scavenged from sunken sailing vessels. The community will consist of roughly equal numbers of mermen, mermaids (as the female of the species is called), and younglings. These communities, no matter the location, will correspond to a human agricultural type community in many respects: there will be workshops, residences, pens for the food fish, and storage areas for the harvested sea vegetation. Merfolk communities are guarded by 3d6 giant gar (q.v.), bred and trained by the mermen for this purpose. Merfolk rarely venture from the ocean but can sometimes be spotted sunning themselves on coastal rocks in isolated areas.

In battle, half the merman troops encountered will be armed with dagger and trident. The remainder of the forces will be evenly split between crossbow and dagger; or net, javelin, and dagger. Mermen crossbows are identical in function to the sahuagin crossbow (see monster listing: sahuagin). If the mermen encountered are seeking to capture a surface ship (see below) 25% of the trident-armed troops will also be equipped with grapples that have 50-ft of line attached.

Though mermen tend to avoid humans under most circumstances, they have been known to attack and sink surface vessels to plunder them. Grappling hook-equipped mermen will surface and hurl their grapples up to 30-ft as the other mermen attack exposed crewman on the ship with crossbows and thrown javelins. The merfolk are quite proficient with grapples and will successfully score a hit on a roll of 1-9 on a 1d10. If a grapple hits it will be grabbed and held by 10 mermen, causing the ship to lose 30-ft per round of top speed for each successful grapple attack. If the crew of the ship manages to cut a grapple line it will take the 10 mermen holding the line a round to regroup and return to the fight. Any merman grappling the ship or laying down cover fire is exposed to ranged attack from the ship. Further, fire-based attacks will cause double damage but only for a single round. If the grappled ship is successfully rendered motionless it will be pulled underwater in 4d4 rounds. Any crewmen abandoning ship at this time will be ignored as the ship and mermen sink beneath the waves. Mermen do not take surface dwellers prisoner, but will not normally harm any crewmen in the water—unless the crew of the ship foolishly try to continue the battle.

_Description:_ Merfolk appear as completely normal humans from the waist up and as man-sized fish or dolphins from the waist down. They disdain clothing, though mermaids will often adorn themselves with plundered jewellery and mermen will use any enchanted weapons and protective magic rings or bracers they may gain in their raids. Mermen speak their own language, 50% speak locathah, and if the merfolk dwell near any other intelligent aquatic creatures at least 10% of the community will be able to speak that tongue as well.

Minotaurs usually like to inhabit vast mazes whether they be underground or outdoors. They are excellent trackers (50% chance to track) and will always give chase if they can see their prey. These beasts are man-eaters and will attack savagely anything they think they can kill and eat. They are stupid and can be tricked.

They will attack with their horns for 2d4 damage if their opponent is medium sized. If their opponent is smaller they will bite for 1d4 damage. Many times minotaurs will carry a very large axe to use as a weapon instead.

Minotaurs can speak their own language and sometimes (25%) can speak common.

Mongrelmen are outcasts, unwelcome in normal society. They seem to be a blend of many different races and have a motley appearance, as if patched together from bits of orc, human, bugbear, elf, and other demi-human and humanoid creatures. They are often abused or enslaved. To avoid this they shun human society and form communities of their own kind, living together in deserted or abandoned towns, villages, and ruins. They speak a strange mixture of human tongues and animal noises, though they can usually (90%) make themselves understood in Common.

Mongrelmen are skilled scroungers and pilferers, having the abilities of a thief of level 1d6+5 (except they cannot backstab). In combat, they use a motley assortment of melee weapons, with 1 in 20 having missile weapons (such as darts or blowguns). These missiles will be coated with poison if available.

For every mongrelman with 4 hit dice, there will be two mongrelmen with 3 hit dice, three with 2 hit dice, and between thirty and fifty with 1 hit dice. Larger lairs will contain a chief of 5 hit dice.

_Treasure:_ (in lair) 2d6×1,000 cp (20%), 1d6×1,000 sp (35%), 1d4×1,000 ep (10%), 1d4 gems (25%), 1d3 jewellery (20%), any two magic items plus two potions (10%).

**Brown mould** can be found in places where it escapes the effects of ultraviolet light. It feeds on most other sources of energy, and absorbs the body heat of any creature that comes within 5-ft. Its heat absorption deals damage to all creatures within range at a rate of 1-8hp for every 10 degrees of body heat over 55 degrees every combat round.

Brown mould grows in the presence of heat, so that the presence of high temperatures can cause the mould to increase its size by a factor of 2d8 times in the course of a melee round.

Magical light which generates no heat will not stimulate brown mould growth. Only magical cold will damage it. An _ice storm_ or _wall of ice_ will make the brown mould go dormant for 5d6 turns.

**Yellow mould:** When touched, yellow mould releases spores in a 10-ft cubed choking cloud. Any creature within this area will die unless it successfully saves vs poison; a character who fails his or her save will require a _cure disease_ and _resurrection_ to be made whole again. If a surface covered in yellow mould is handled roughly, there is a 50% chance spores will be released in such a cloud.

Yellow mould is susceptible only to fire and fire attacks. A _continual light_ spell will force the mould to go dormant for 2d6 turns until it covers the light source.

A **guardian naga** appears as a long, snake-like creature with a human head, golden eyes, and green-gold scales. The scales along its spine are triangular and silvery.

Guardian naga are mostly found in holy places. They serve as sentinels over some ancient evil or treasure belonging to the cause of good. The bite of the guardian naga is poisonous and inflicts 1d6 hp while its constriction deals 2d8 hp. It can spit its poison up to 30-ft at any single target, and the target must save vs poison or die

A guardian naga can use divine spells as a 6th level cleric:

1st level: 3  
2nd Level: 3  
3rd level: 2  

_Treasure:_ 5d6×1cp (25%), 1d%×1,000 sp (15%), 10d4×1,000 ep (40%), 10d6×1,000 gp (55%), 5d10×100 pp (25%), 1d% gems (50%), 10d4 jewellery (50%), any 4 magic item + 1 potion + 1 scroll (15%)

The evil and corrupt **spirit naga** dwells in deep ruins and other subterranean places. Its scales are black with blood red bands, and its human-like head is large and misshapen.

The spirit naga's bite is poisonous (1d3) and it can permanently charm any humanoid that meets its gaze unless the target successfully makes a saving throw vs paralysation.

A spirit naga can use divine and arcane spells to 4th and 5th levels respectively:

Divine:  
1st level: 3  
2nd level: 2  

Arcane:  
1st level: 4  
2nd level: 2

The **water naga's** scales range from deep green to turquoise and its eye colour varies from light green to brilliant amber. It dwells deep below the surface of fresh water lakes ponds and rivers. The water naga is typically quite curious and harmless unless provoked. In combat, its poisonous bite deals 1d4 damage, and it can cast arcane spells as a 5th level magic user:

1st level: 4  
2nd level: 2  
3rd level: 1  

_Treasure:_ 1d8×1,000 cp (10%), 1d12×1,000 sp (15%), 1d8×1,000 ep (15%), 1d6×1,000 gp (50%), 1d10 gems (30%), 1d6 jewellery (25%), any 2 magic item + 1 potion (15%)

Known to common folk as the “death worm”, the necrophidius is a skeletal giant snake with a fanged skull of an adult human male for a head. Death worms move completely silently, and are immune to _sleep_, _charm_, mind-affecting spells; they never check morale and they are immune to poison. In spite of these and other similarities to the undead, the necrophidius is not an undead creature and cannot be turned by a cleric.

A necrophidius will surprise its prey 50% of the time. If it is not surprised it will begin its _Dance of Death_. This attack is a swaying, hypnotic dance that will dominate its victim's attention if he or she fails a saving throw vs petrifaction. An individual so dominated will stand completely motionless and unresisting as the necrophidius advances upon him or her.

In combat the necrophidius attacks with a bite for 1d8 hp. This bite inflicts a magical paralysis upon its victim for 1d4 turns unless the target makes his or her saving throw.

A necrophidius is a construct and there are several ways to go about creating one. First, the basic materials must be assembled: the skull of a cold-blooded murderer who has been killed within 72 hours of the ritual and the complete skeleton of a giant snake. The process will also require 10 days plus the services and laboratory of an alchemist, who will charge his or her full monthly fee plus 500 gp per hp of the completed necrophidius. At the end of 10 days, the potential owner has 24 hours to complete the ritual by one of the methods detailed hereafter;

First, a magical book can be used. These work the same way as a _**manual of the golems**_ (q.v.) can be used to create a golem. Second, a high level magic user can cast the following spells in this order upon the pre-necrophidius alchemical mixture: _limited wish_, _geas_, and _charm person_. Upon completion of the _charm person_ spell the death worm magically assembles from the various parts, absorbing the fluids of the mixture. Last, a cleric can cast the following divine spells upon the pre-necrophidius alchemical mixture in this precise order: _quest_, _neutralise poison_, _prayer_, _silence 15-ft radius_, and _snake charm_. As with the magic user, when the last spell is completed the necrophidius magically assembles from the various parts, absorbing the fluids of the mixture.

Because of the artificial nature of the necrophidius, they are never encountered in a lair or as a wandering monster. Instead, they are created for a specific purpose, usually as an assassin or guard. They are perfect for this role because they never sleep, they never check morale, and they never give up.

Nereids are transparent and invisible in water. On land they appear as young, slim and beautiful human women. They are playful and capricious, but few (10%) are actually evil. An equally small number are good. In extremis they can attack with their spittle (range 20-ft) that blinds its target for 1d12 rounds, but they can also control the water of their homes, speeding or slowing swimming movement through it (up to double normal speed, or down to 25% of it), causing crashing waves that deafen, prevent conversation and interrupt spell-casting, or forming miniature waterspouts that attack as 4 HD monsters (inflicting 1d4hp damage—no more than one such waterspout per nereid per round).

Males of any human, demi-human or humanoid species cannot harm a nereid at all. They will be infatuated with the nereid (no save) and seek to woo her. A man can try to catch the nereid—but she will turn to water and flow away from his embrace 50% of the time. If caught and held, she will kiss him, in which case he must save vs poison or drown.

A nereid will always have a diaphanous shawl that contains her soul. Anyone holding the shawl can control her; she will obey their commands out of fear, even if they are male. A nereid will do almost anything short of physical violence to regain her shawl.

_Treasure:_ One miscellaneous magic item and one potion (65%).

Night hags resemble hideous women with clawed hands and feet. Their skin is dark blue-violet, their talons and lanky hair jet, their eyes red with a baneful glow.

Night hags are numerous in their own region of Hades, but seldom found elsewhere. If success seems likely, they will attack any good aligned creature. They come to the material plane to slay very selfishly evil people, whose souls in Hades form soul worms (q.v.: a valuable demonic and diabolical commodity).

Finding such a victim, a night hag casts a _sleep_ spell that affects humans even up to 12th level who fail a saving throw vs magic, then strangles the sleeper. If the spell fails, she returns nightly while æthereal, which she can assume at will. By entering the victim's dreams, the hag makes him (or her) æthereal as well. Each ride until dawn by the hag (who cannot be unseated from the unfortunate's back) permanently drains a point of constitution. When all points are drained, the victim dies and the night hag carries the soul to Hades.

A night hag can cast a _magic missile_ spell for 2d8 damage or a _ray of enfeeblement_ thrice per day each. She has the power of knowing a creature's alignment, and can polymorph herself at will.

Night hags are invulnerable to charm, fear, sleep, and cold- or fire-based spells. To harm them, a weapon must be of iron or silver or enchanted to +3 or better.

In extremis, a night hag can try (succeeding half the time) to _gate_ in an ally, with equal chances of a barbed devil or class A demon appearing. She must then reward the devil or demon with a soul worm, a price the night hags will be loath to pay.

While she has a special periapt she has forged in Hades, a night hag can astrally project her body at will. Upon losing the periapt, she can still depart the plane she is in at the time. This periapt gives the possessor +2 on all saving throws, and _cures diseases_ the possessor contracts. With each use by a good creature, the periapt decays; after ten uses, it vanishes.

_Treasure:_ Periapt (listed above)

Nightmares serve as mounts for powerful evil beings. Whilst in shape they resemble large warhorses, they are unmistakably otherworldly, having blood red eyes, fiery nostrils, powerful fangs, a midnight black coat, a mane of shadow and hooves that appear to leap aflame when they run. Though it is known that Nightmares can understand what their riders ask of them, they are not thought to be able to speak themselves; but they seem to be able to communicate with one another well enough.

Although most Nightmares do not possess wings, they can fly through the air considerably faster than they can run along the ground. Their capacity for such swift flight is greatly valued by those they serve, as is their ferocity in combat. Nightmares hate living creatures and, being given to viciousness, will generally attack any non-evil entity they encounter. They use their fangs to bite for 2d4 damage and strike with their hooves 1d6+4 damage, which will also set any flammable objects they strike alight. In their excitement, Nightmares are also known to produce a noxious smoke that causes anyone within ten feet to have to save vs paralysis or suffer a -2 penalty “to hit” and damage whilst in the vicinity.

Nightmares have a strong sense of purpose and this can make them difficult to control; it takes an iron will or powerful magic for a rider to perpetually retain mastery. It is thought that their services can also be bargained for, but exactly what evil such an agreement might entail is unknown.

If ridden by a creature weighing more than 100 lbs, the nightmare's aerial agility level is reduced to III.

This monster looks and acts exactly like a goblin, even speaking the same language. The one difference between a goblin and nilbog, however, is a very important one. Goblins infected with nilbogism are surrounded by a weakness in the eldritch fabric that separates magic and magical energy from reality. Whereas in most cases such weaknesses result in null magic zones, when contained within the nilbog's life essence these tears in reality have a completely different effect.

Results of being in the presence of a nilbog are chaotic and unpredictable, but always totally contrary to what the adventurer would normally desire.

A thief sneaking into a nilbog lair might start singing at the top of her voice, a magic user might discard a travelling spell book or favourite magic wand, or a party might feel compelled to fill an empty treasure chest in the nilbog lair with their most valuable items. Persons encountering a nilbog have no choice to avoid these reversed sensibilities; no saving throw is allowed. A _wish_ spell or similarly powerful magic should provide a short-lived and limited area immunity to the effects of nilbogism.

Nilbogism also asserts its effect in combat. Striking a nilbog or casting damaging spells at it actually adds hp to the creature equal to the amount of damage that would have been inflicted normally. The only way to damage a nilbog appears to be curative magic, such as casting a _cure light wounds_ spell on it. This harms the creature rather than healing it. (Some adventurers report success with force-feeding the nilbog _**healing**_ potions.)

Because nilbogs look exactly like goblins, the only way to tell one from the other is to approach it. Of course, since approaching a nilbog subjects one to the effects of nilbogism this is a risky method, at best.

Even more rarely, nilbogism occurs in other creatures, the most ludicrous of which is the llort—a troll-like creature that if cured of damage, begins to degenerate at 3hp per round until dead.

_Treasure:_ 1d10×1,000 cp (25%), 2d4×1,000 sp (33%), 1d6×1,000 ep (15%), 2d4 gems (30%), 2d4 jewellery (25%), 2 magic scrolls+1 potion (25%)

These nightmarish creatures have the body of a large bear with the head of an owl. They are voracious eaters and possessed of a foul temper. They will attack anything that moves on sight and will fight to the death. They are typically found in temperate forests.

The owlbear attacks first with its claws and beak. If it scores an 18 or better on a hit with either of its paws, the creature is ensnared in the owlbear's hug and proceeds to take an additional 2d8 point of damage that round and every following round until the owlbear is slain.

_Description:_ The pelt of an owlbear ranges in colour from brownish-black to a golden-brown with feathers interspersed with the fur. Males weigh from 1,300 to 1,500 lbs and tend to have the darker colouration. The terrible beaks of these beasts vary from ivory to yellow in colour.

Otyughs are repulsive beasts that feed off the refuse and waste habitually discarded by other creatures. They are generally found in large rubbish pits and cisterns, being not always content with discards, they wait beneath the surface for anyone foolish enough to stray too close. Otyughs have no discernible head, the bulk of their form consisting of a great horn-plated torso supported by three stocky legs that conceal a powerful, sharp-toothed maw. Three long tentacular appendages extend from their bodies, two of which are hard and thorny, being used to attack and grapple prey; the third is actually a sensory organ with three eyes at its end, which are capable of 90-ft infravision. Lesser Otyughs are also capable of limited telepathy at a range of up to 30-ft, and Greater Otyughs up to 60 ft, but such communication is limited to simple thoughts and ideas.

Whilst Otyughs suffer no ill-effects from bright light, they do not like it, preferring to dwell in dark places that help them to strike with complete surprise, though their eyes, usually protruding above the surface, sometimes give them away. They can use their great tentacle like limbs to strike for 1d8 damage, or 1d12 in the case of the Greater Otyugh, but may also attempt to grapple their prey. Grappled opponents suffer 1d3+1 points of constriction damage per round and bite attacks against them are made with +2 to hit. A character with 18 strength can break free after one round of struggling, but other characters must make a successful Open Doors roll to do the same. Greater Otyughs may use grappled characters as shields; in doing so, they gain a +1 bonus to armour class and when attacked may make an attack roll of their own, which if successful results in the grappled character becoming the victim of the attack. Any character unfortunate enough to be bitten by an Otyugh is extremely likely to contract a disease, 1 in 5 cases of which are fatal.

_Treasure:_ Otyughs possess little in the way of treasure; what meagre sums might be found in their lairs are either the remains of previous victims or have been accidentally discarded.

A pegasus is a winged horse who lives in secluded areas far from civilisation. They are intelligent, but very wild and untamed. They do not trust men and must be approached very carefully. If they can be caught and tamed, they become very devoted mounts. They will however only serve a good aligned master. If mounted by a creature weighing more than 100 lbs, the pegasus' aerial agility level decreases to III.

Like a horse, a pegasus will buck with its two front hooves and bite with its mouth. A pegasus stallion is equal in size and strength to a medium warhorse. A pegasus mare is equivalent to a light warhorse.

Neither a monster nor the undead in the truest sense of the word, a phantom is a sort of endless loop three-dimensional visual manifestation “recorded” at the time of a person's death. These images usually depict either the death of the person or whatever was foremost in his or her mind. Phantoms have no intelligence, nor can they harm anyone directly.

Phantoms are surrounded by a field of supernatural energy which normal animals react strongly toward and will not approach. Humans or demi-humans encountering a phantom must save vs spells or immediately panic and flee as though under the influence of a _fear_ spell.

Phantoms are often misidentified as other types of immaterial undead creatures such as ghosts or banshees, but phantoms cannot be turned as an undead creature. A cleric casting _exorcise_ can dispel a phantom presence.

The phoenix is a creature that sages believe originates from one of the good aligned Outer Planes. Information provided here applies to Prime Material Plane encounters only. Often referred to by the common folk as a “firebird” or “bennu bird,” sighting a phoenix is believed to be a good omen and a mark of divine favour. Though the phoenix is a creature of the Outer Planes, it finds great joy in scenes of tranquil beauty and is therefore most often encountered deep in sylvan woods, in the company of fey creatures and woodland animals. Though a phoenix is a formidable foe many of its body parts are prized by alchemists and wizards and as a result, a phoenix in the Prime Material Plane avoids contact with most living creatures besides the fey denizens of the deep woods. Even good-aligned characters seeking its help will be viewed with a degree of mistrust, at least initially.

In combat, the phoenix employs one of two attack routines; either two clawing attacks when airborne or one beak attack if not. What makes the phoenix even more imposing in combat, however, are its myriad spell-like abilities and special powers. Through the use of these abilities, it is difficult even to engage the creature in combat if it desires to avoid it.

Due to its other-planar nature, the phoenix can only be hit with +3 or better weapons. The creature can constantly and automatically _detect charm_, _detect evil_, and _detect magic_; constantly radiates _protection from fear, 10__\-__ft radius_, and has a 50% magic resistance. The phoenix can become astral or æthereal at will, and once per week can transport itself and up to 10 man-sized creatures to its home plane (it can also reach its home dimension through the use of its astral and æthereal ability). A phoenix has finely-honed senses and therefore cannot be surprised. It receives +3 to all initiative rolls. The phoenix has 120-ft range in both infravision and low-light vision. This amazing being can heal itself or another creature spontaneously, up to 100 hit points total per day. It can also _cure disease_ with but a touch of its beak, limited to one _cure disease_ per creature per day. It can also cast _cure light wounds_ at will with a brush of its wingtips, though any human or humanoid can only be healed thus twice during any one day. A phoenix has the innate ability to cause a tremendous heat up to thrice per day; igniting all flammable materials, boiling liquids, and blistering exposed skin. It can also dissipate any energy based attack, ranging from spells to dragon breath, up to thrice per day and taking no damage therefrom. Its powerful voice can _dispel illusion_ and _dispel magic_ at a level equal to a 40th level magic user, and cast _exorcise_ as a 40th level cleric.

In addition to all the above, the phoenix can use the following spell-like abilities at will, once per round at a 20th level of ability, unless otherwise noted: _affect normal fires_, _audible glamour_, _blink_, _blindness_, _blur_, _control temperature 50__\-ft_ _radius_, _continual light_, _find traps_, _fire charm_, _fire shield_, _improved invisibility_, _misdirection_, _produce flame_, _pyrotechnics_, _remove curse_, _remove fear 10__\-ft_ _radius_, _snake charm_. Once per day, the phoenix can use the following spell-like abilities, again at 20th level: _call woodland beings_, _duo__\-__dimension_, _find the path_, _fire quench_ (reverse of the druid spell _produce fire_), _fire seeds_, _fire storm_, _neutralise poison_, _reincarnate_, _veil_ and _wall of fire_. Thrice per day the phoenix can cast _colour spray_, _heat metal_, _polymorph self_, and once per week can cast _incendiary cloud_.

The phoenix has two final special abilities it will only use when great need is upon it. First, it can fire up to 8 of its feathers at its opponents per round. These feathers will sap 5 hp apiece from the phoenix and explode as a holly berry _fire seed_. If overcome in battle, the phoenix can release its version of a retributive strike—invoking a hellish firestorm of destruction equal in power to a _firestorm_ combined with an _incendiary cloud_, each cast at 40th level of ability. This mega-firestorm can be created even if both spell abilities have already been used that day. This attack will kill the phoenix (and most likely everything else within range) but leaves behind a crystalline egg the size of an adult human head. A new phoenix will arise from the egg in 3d8 days.

_Description:_ The phoenix is a large bird vaguely resembling a stork or heron, with beautiful plumage of bright gold and fiery red that catches the light in a manner reminiscent of dancing flames. Its dagger-sharp claws and long, hard beak are an iridescent violet; the eyes of a phoenix have been described as rubies glowing with an inner fire. The phoenix speaks the language of its kind; the language of any feathered, flying creature; and can communicate with other creatures with either telepathy or telempathy, as appropriate to the level of intelligence of the other creature.

A piercer looks exactly like a stalactite. It is a living creature encased in a stone covering. Piercers are sensitive to noise and heat and when they detect a source of either passing beneath them they drop, seeking to kill and devour their target.

A piercer has a single attack, seeking to impale the unlucky victim with its sharp point. After killing and feasting the piercer will move via tiny cilia in its base back up to the ceiling. Any grouping of piercers will include a mix of the various HD, roll 1d4 with 1 = 1 HD, 2 = 2 HD, 3 = 3 HD, and 4 = 4 HD. A piercer will do 1d6 of damage for each of its HD.

The 1 HD piercer is 3-ft long and weighs about 200 lbs. With each additional HD the piercer adds another foot of length and another 100 lbs of weight. Piercers devour even the bones of their victims and any intelligent cave or dungeon dwelling denizens living nearby will often (carefully) scavenge any armour, weapons, money, magic, or anything else remaining of even the least value.

Pseudo-dragons are tiny dragons, dark red in colour, lacking the breath weapon of their large cousins but carrying a deadly sting in their tails. Because of the lack of a breath weapon, they are not generally counted among the true dragons. Pseudo-dragons can be be found in almost every climate save the very hottest and coldest, and prefer snug lairs such as small caves or hollow trees.

In combat the pseudo-dragon will attack with a bite attack for 1d3 points of damage, but its feared weapon is its sting. The pseudo-dragon's small size and great flying speed, coupled with the flexibility of its tail, grant a +4 bonus to stinging attacks. Any creature stung is allowed a save vs poison to negate the effects, otherwise the victim will fall into a death-like trance for 1d6 days. On the last day of the trance there is a 25% chance the victim will actually die.

Pseudo-dragons have a chameleon ability and are able to change their normal dark red colouration to match their surroundings and becoming 80% undetectable to creatures not able to see invisible. Pseudo-dragons can themselves see invisible objects.

These creatures also have an innate magic resistance and are able to grant this resistance to its human or demi-human companions by touch. Pseudo-dragons are also able to communicate everything they see and hear to its companion via a limited form of _telepathy_ at distances of up to 240-ft. These abilities make the pseudo-dragon a highly-prized familiar or pet.

_Treasure:_ 50% chance 1d4 gems (lair: 50% chance of 10d4 gems).

Purple worms are huge, almost 10-ft around and 40-ft to 50-ft long. They live deep underground where they are constantly on the search for food. They are attracted to vibrations up to 60-ft away. These creatures always return to their lair to rest. During this time they will pass their waste consisting of metals and gems they could not digest.

A purple worm's main attack is its bite that does 2d12 points of damage. If the purple worm scores a natural 20 then it has engulfed its prey whole. If the victim is not rescued, it will die within 6 rounds. It is also possible for the victim to cut it's way out. The inside of a purple worm is armour class 10. For each round that the victim is inside subtract 1 from their damage that they inflict. This penalty is cumulative for each round, so after four rounds the damage inflicted is at -4. As well as its bite a purple worm also has a poisonous stinger on its tail. Any creature stung takes 2d4 damage and must save vs poison or die.

Rakshasas are evil spirits. Their main diet is human flesh and they use deception to get it. When first encountered a rakshasa will use its _ESP_ to detect whomever the victim trusts, then use illusion to assume that form. Once the victim lets his or her guard down the rakshasa will reveal its true self and attack. Rakshasas are able to cast 1st to 3rd level magic user spells as well as 1st level cleric spells. Rakshasas themselves are only affected by 8th level and higher magic. They are immune to normal weapons and magical weapons below +3 only do half damage. They do however have one weakness: a crossbow bolt blessed by a cleric will kill them instantly.

These great polar worms are found only in arctic areas. The remorhaz attacks on sight, and if encountered in its lair there is a 1 in 4 chance it has a mate and 1d3 eggs; the eggs can be sold on some markets for 5,000 gp each.

The HD of the remorhaz determines its length: starting at 21-ft, each hit die above 7 adds 3-ft, so that a 14 HD specimen will be roughly 42-ft long. The remorhaz is ice-blue in colour, with white protrusions along its back and white insect-like eyes.

When attacking, the remorhaz rises on the back section of its body and begins beating its bat-like wings. Its attack is blinding, and the larger-sized remorhaz can swallow its prey whole. All remorhaz generate an intense internal heat that instantly destroys any swallowed opponent. An opponent is swallowed and destroyed if the remorhaz' attack score is a 20.

When aroused for combat, the internal heat of the remorhaz seeps up into the protrusions on the back of the creature. Non-magical weapons that strike the back will melt, and any physical touch deals 10d10 hp damage.

Rocs are powerful creatures living at high elevations in warm environments, and look somewhat like a huge eagles. They will sometimes be found with giants, who keep them as pets. The immense size of a roc is accompanied by its equally immense appetites, as rocs will frequently consume large mammals including horses and cattle. A roc hunts much like an eagle, swooping down on its meal and capturing it in its immense claws, carrying it back to its nest. A roc will silence struggling prey by impaling it with its powerful beak for 4d6 hit points of damage.

Any treasure found in the gigantic nests of rocs is there purely on accident, since rocs have no concept of wealth. The belongings of past victims will be found woven into the intricate nest.

Ropers are cavern-dwelling monsters and are frequently mistaken for stalagmites. These monsters are grey-green in colour, standing around 8-ft to 12-ft tall, with a hide that mimics the smooth limestone formations of a natural cavern.

Ropers are about 3-ft to 4-ft at the base and approximately 1-ft wide at the apex. These monsters are almost always encountered in their stalagmite shape but can alter their appearance to some degree. A roper can assume the shape of a pillar, a boulder, or flatten themselves and lie flat to appear as no more than an irregularity on the walking surface of the cavern floor. It can also cling to a cavern ceiling (or wall) and appear as a stalactite. Through means of tiny adhesive cilia on its underside, the roper can move slowly and these cilia are what allow it to cling upside down to the ceiling. Ropers are predators and attack by means of the 6 rope-like appendages that give these monsters their name. The ropes secrete a powerful and poisonous adhesive and can lash out some distance from the creature; up to 50-ft. A successful “to hit” roll will weaken the target, decreasing its strength ability score by 50% (rounded down) within 1d3 rounds and lasting 2d4 turns; with multiple hits having a cumulative strength drain effect. An ensnared victim can break the strand by performing a Minor Test of Strength but for every round the victim is roped he or she will be dragged 10-ft closer to the roper. Creatures within 10-ft of the roper are subject to its vicious bite attack, this attack automatically hits any victim held by the strands of the roper. A strand can be sliced with an edged weapon but the attack must do a minimum of 6 points of damage in a single attack to the AC 0 tentacle to sever it. The strand of a roper can easily pull 800 lbs and can lift about a third of that amount.

A roper is a tough monster. The stony hide grants it AC 0 in combat and it has an innate resistance to magic. Besides its base 80% magic resistance, the roper is completely immune to electricity based damage including lightning, ropers are also resistant to cold based magic and take only half damage from any such attacks. These creatures have few weaknesses but are susceptible to fire, saving vs fire based attacks at -4. Any fire based magic attacks, however, must still overcome the monster's magic resistance.

Ropers do not hoard treasure but their acidic bile cannot dissolve platinum or gemstones. Cutting open the gizzard of a roper has a 40% chance of yielding 3d6 (3-18) platinum pieces and 30% chance of 4d6 (4-24) gems.

**Quartz Roper:** To adventurers familiar with ropers, a quartz roper appears as a 5-ft tall and 2-ft wide (at the base) statue of a roper hewn from some brownish or smoky grey crystalline mineral. The quartz roper is actually a monster with a rocky hide composed of living quartz. Quartz ropers are very sensitive to motion and are able to sense movement up to 225-ft away.

In combat, quartz ropers fight in a manner similar to ropers (q.v.): its tentacles can hit targets up to 50-ft away, the poisonous adhesive of the tentacles inflicts a 50% strength penalty on its targets, and it drags roped victims toward itself to deliver its nasty bite automatically.

A quartz roper also differs from its larger cousins in a number of ways. First, it tends to concentrate its first attacks on two victims, striking each with 3 tentacles. The first two successfully roped victims will be injected with a venom which allows no saving throw and causes the victim to freeze in place, looking as if he or she has been turned to stone. One round after this apparent stoning the victim recovers but is now under the delusion the quartz roper is a close friend and valued ally. These influenced adventurers will fight to protect the monster to the utmost of their abilities for the duration of effect of the venom; 10 turns. If the quartz roper is killed before the venom expires, the deluded defenders will cease attacking and wander about aimlessly until the venom expires. The quartz roper can only inject its venom twice per day and afterward its combat tactics conform to those of a roper. A quartz roper's tentacles are strong, but not so strong as the larger variety of roper. A roped character's chances of breaking free are equal to double his or her chance to perform a Minor Test of Strength.

Quartz ropers also lack a roper's magic resistance but its mineral-laden hide will resist normal missile fire, though _magic missiles_ and hand held weapons damage it normally. All magic spells do normal damage as well. A quartz roper's gizzard has the same percentage chance of containing platinum pieces and gemstones as the standard variety of roper.

Although rot grubs can be found in animal waste and other foul refuse, they prefer to consume tissue that is still alive. Upon contact with a living being, rot grubs will begin to vigorously burrow deep into the body. Fire must be applied to the site of contact at once in order to prevent the rot grubs from burrowing further. This application of flame inflicts 1d6 hit points of damage per instance. If not stopped immediately, within 1 to 3 turns the rot grubs will find the heart and kill their victim.

Rust monsters are creatures vaguely resembling a 5-ft long and 3-ft tall giant bug-like armadillo that weighs about 200 lbs. Rust monsters have rust-red colouration on their dorsal hides, yellowish tan on their ventral hides, and two prehensile antennae on their heads.

Rust monsters are only found in underground type environments, which they prowl constantly in search of food.

Rust monsters consume metal of any kind, especially ferrous metals and ferrous metal alloys. The antennae of a rust monster can “smell” metal 90-ft away, and the creature will dart toward such a source of food with blinding speed, rolling 2 attacks with its antennae at the largest piece of metal it can sense. A successful attack causes up to 10 cubic-ft of metal instantly to crumble into easily-digestible rust and the creature will immediately cease attacking in such a case and begin devouring its newly-created meal. Metal with magical bonuses gains a 10% chance per plus of not being affected by the rust monsters attack. For instance a +3 shield would have a 30% of resisting the rusting effect. A successful “to hit” roll against a rust monster with a metal weapon automatically subjects that weapon to a rust attack.

Rust monsters are motivated by animal intelligence and blind hunger, therefore can be easily distracted from pursuit by dropping metal objects and fleeing; some iron spikes or a heavy mace will cause the attacking rust monster to stop for 1 round to devour the treat. Otherwise, rust monsters will relentlessly pursue the PCs until slain or all metal items have been consumed.

Sahuagin are humanoid ichthyans of evil alignment. They dwell in shallow, warmer salt waters and raid villages and communities on land for loot and sport. They are nocturnal.

Each sahuagin realm has a King and is divided into nine provinces, each ruled by a Prince. Each Prince will have a number of Barons under his command, and each Baron controls a war-band. The “Number Encountered” listing for this creature is for the lair of a typical war-band; the lairs of a Prince will be much larger.

If encountered outside their lair, there will be no females or hatchlings, no priestesses or above, and the band will be led by a warchief.

Sahuagin are typically armed as follows:

Dagger and spear 25% of the band Dagger, trident and net 50% of the band Dagger and heavy crossbow 25% of the band

All these weapons are fully usable both above and below the water, which makes them quite highly prized.

The sahuagin clergy will always be led by a priestess with 6 HD and the spell casting powers of an 8th level cleric. The remaining priestesses will be trainees of 2nd to 7th level (1d6+1). Their HD are equal to their spell casting level -2 (minimum 2). Sahuagin priestesses will typically be attended by zombie or skeleton servants, as they are fond of the _animate dead_ spell.

Sahuagin have been known to tame sharks and keep them as pets.

Large, huge and giant scorpions are vicious, fearless predators found almost anywhere. Their usual tactic is to attack anything smaller than themselves. The scorpion will try and grab its prey with its huge claws then sting it to death with its tail. While its tail only does 1d4 points of damage the victim must save vs poison or die. The scorpion can use its attacks independently of each other on 3 different targets. Anything that the scorpion kills is taken back to its lair and consumed. It should be noted that the scorpion is not immune to its own poison; if it stings itself it could die.

Sea hags are wretched creatures given to committing dreadful acts of evil. They typically make their lairs beneath the ocean depths, but they are occasionally found in large lakes or other significant bodies of water. Their true form is that of a decrepit old woman, ravaged by time and repellent beyond reason, but they generally use their magic to assume a much more pleasant visage. They have sharp claws and teeth, as well as an insatiable appetite for flesh. Most sea hags are thought to be capable of speaking a number of languages.

The appearance of a sea hag belies their true abilities, for they are all supernaturally swift and strong, but more potent are their magical abilities. They take particular delight in their ability to use change self to deceive the unwary, either luring them to an unpleasant and immediate death or as part of a more subtle scheme; they can use this power at will and the duration is unlimited. Should a sea hag's true appearance ever be revealed, then the horror causes anyone within thirty feet to be subject to a saving throw versus spells to avoid losing half their strength score for 1d6 turns. Furthermore, a sea hag can employ an _evil gaze_ up to three times per day that subjects one creature within thirty feet to a saving throw vs poison; failure results in immediate collapse and paralysis for three days, though for 1 in 4 victims the effect is stronger and causes instant death. If physical combat becomes unavoidable, sea hags will attack with a weapon or their sharp claws; regardless, they have +3 “to hit” and +3 to damage. Sea hags are immune to _charm_, _fear_, _sleep_ and fire- or cold-based spells and immune to weapons that are not forged of cold iron, silver or else enchanted with at least a +1 bonus.

Descriptions of sea serpents vary with the region in which they are found. Sometimes they appear as giant sea snakes and other times as dragon-like serpentine creatures with legs or flippers. What is known for certain is a sea serpent can be encountered in any ocean, sea, or large body of fresh water. Sea serpents have two attacks. It has a poisonous bite for 1d6 points of damage and death in 1d4 rounds, save vs poison to negate; and a coiling attack which can crush a ship or creature in 1d6+4 (5-10) rounds. Sea serpents are very territorial but are not otherwise aggressive, only attacking when hungry. Once a sea serpent attacks, however, it is fearless and relentless and will fight to the death. Sea serpents are capable of diving to great depths and staying underwater for long periods of time. Sea serpents only lair in caves in very deep water and tend to be solitary or, at most, a mated pair.

Shambling mounds appear to be piles of rotting vegetation. They are a type of intelligent plant. They dwell deep underground and in swamps, wherever there is ample moisture and decay. Shambling mounds will eat anything organic. They feed by wrapping their roots around their prey and absorbing the nutrients as the material rots.

When attacking, the shambling mound swings its arms around wildly. If both arms strike the same target within the same round, that target has become tangled up inside the creature. The victim will be smothered in 2d4 rounds unless the monster can be killed.

These things are rugged since the actual creature is surrounded by layers upon layers of rotting material. Fire has no effect as they are so wet, nothing will burn.

Electricity will actually cause the shambling mound to grow, add an additional hit die. Cold based attacks do no damage if the creature makes it save, half if it does. Weapons only do half damage as well. Shambling mounds are vulnerable to spells that affect plants such as plant control or charm plant.

Shedu are winged bulls with human heads. They wander endlessly battling evil and chaos. They will aid anyone of good alignment, who is in need. They are powerful magic users who cast with a 9th level ability. If attacked, they will defend themselves with their front hooves. Shedu not only travel the material plane but the æthereal and astral planes as well. They can become æthereal at will. Shedu speak their own language, using their _telepathy_ to communicate with others.

Shriekers are mobile fungi that wander around quietly underground soaking up moisture. They are the favourite food of purple worms and shambling mounds. They give off an ear-piercing shriek whenever they detect light within 30-ft or movement within 10-ft. Shriekers will continue to shriek for 1d3 rounds, with a 50% chance to attract a wandering monster each round.

Skeleton warriors are the unfortunate victims of powerful magic; in life they were fighters of great prowess and likely lords in their own right. In death they have become abominations, compelled by evil sorcery to serve any who possess the golden circlets that contain their souls. Skeleton warriors desire above all else to gain possession of their own circlet and to be revenged upon any who have possessed and used it in the past.

The appearance of a skeleton warrior is terrifying and creatures with less than five HD will panic and flee from its presence. A visage of desiccated and decaying flesh hanging from exposed bone is perhaps fearsome enough, but the flame-red eyes that stare forth from black sockets are said to haunt the dreams of those upon whom they look. They are generally armed and armoured with the remains of what they wore in life, or their grave goods.

A character in possession of the circlet of a skeleton warrior and within 240-ft may attempt to dominate it. The circlet must be worn on the attempting character's head in order to do this; it cannot be used whilst wearing a helmet or similar headgear. On the first attempt at domination, the character has a chance of success equal to his or her Wisdom score×5, but he or she must be able to see his or her victim and have the freedom to concentrate for one round. If the attempt fails, it may be attempted again on the following round. If concentration is interrupted before domination is achieved, such as by an attack, the character must concentrate for a further three rounds. During this time, the Skeleton Warrior will attempt to kill its would-be master and take possession of the circlet if such is at all possible.

In the event of successful domination, the skeleton warrior is rendered inert for as long as the character remains in possession of the circlet. Additionally, whenever they are within 240-ft of one another and the character wears the circlet without helmet as described above, the user may take control of the Skeleton Warrior, being able to see through its eyes and direct its actions as he or she desires; whilst controlling the actions of the skeleton warrior, the user may not act him- or herself.

Should the user lose possession of the circlet for any reason, the skeleton warrior will seek him or her out and slay him or her, moving at double its usual movement rate. In the event that the skeleton warrior ever regains possession of its circlet, it will place it upon its head and as a result both will turn to dust.

Skeleton warriors are powerful combatants, may use any weapon and always have a +3 bonus to hit; they can only be harmed by magical weapons.

The lair of a skeleton warrior is normally a richly adorned tomb filled with considerable treasure. However, because they are usually either seeking the current possessor of their circlet or else in the unwilling service of said possessor, they are rarely found in their lairs.

Contrary to appearances, the skeleton warrior is not undead in the conventional sense. It cannot be turned, is unaffected by a scroll of protection from undead, etc.

Slithering trackers live in dungeons, ruins and dark places. They are transparent and if not in natural sunlight are almost impossible to see (1 in 20 chance of spotting). They almost never attack their prey immediately, instead following and waiting until their target is asleep. They can follow through almost anything, being amorphous in shape and capable of seeping through tiny gaps, such as door jambs or cracks in stonework. If a slithering tracker catches its victim asleep, it will touch it, forcing the victim to roll a saving throw vs paralysation or be totally paralysed for 1d6 hours. The tracker will then feed directly on its victim's life energy, killing it in 1 hour.

_Treasure:_ (in lair) 1d10×1,000 cp (20%), 1d6×1,000 sp (25%), 1d3×1,000 ep (10%), 1d4 gems (20%), 1d2 jewellery (20%), any two magic items (5%).

Green slime is an occasional dungeon hazard. Sages debate whether it is vegetable or fungoid in nature. It grows over the ceiling of an area until a pendulous bulb of slime is almost ready to drop. The vibrations from passing creatures cause these bulbs to fall.

If a bulb strikes exposed flesh, it will convert the flesh rapidly to green slime. It can also eat through wood (slowly) and metal (quickly—a metal item will be consumed in 1d6 rounds). Only stone can stop it.

Green slime is unharmed by most weapons or spells. It does take damage from cold or fire, and can be killed by a _cure disease_ spell. Failing that, a creature with green slime on it must cut away the affected area, amputate the affected limb, or die in 1d4 rounds (after which it will be converted to green slime and cannot be raised or resurrected).

Giant slugs live in dungeons and other underground complexes where they can avoid sunlight. Since these creatures are boneless they can squeeze through narrow openings and navigate around most obstructions. They use their sharp tongues to burrow through wood and hard ground. Giant slugs have a nasty bite, but their most effective weapon is their ability to spit acid up to 100-ft away. The first shot is almost always a miss (only 10% chance to hit), but this attack serves to approximate distance. After the first shot the chance hitting is base 100%, going down 10% for every 10-ft distance from giant slug; thus at 20-ft away the chance to hit is 80%, at 70-ft away 30%, etc. Because of their tough, flexible bodies, non-magical blunt weapons do no damage against giant slugs—only edged, piercing, or magical blunt weapons can harm them.

These creatures are usually a pale light grey with a white belly, but can be brown or black.

All giant snakes are carnivorous and can be found in every type of climate except for the coldest. NB: For giant sea snakes see the listing for _sea serpent_.

**Boas** will drop on its prey from above, coiling its long body around the chosen target victim and attacking by both biting and squeezing for 2d4 points of damage. Once a snake has a victim within its coils it is quite difficult to release him or her. Several strong creatures creatures can grasp each end of the snake and uncoil the victim in 1d4+1 segments. Four very strong humans, 16 or greater strength each, should be able to accomplish this task. Attacks directed against a snake will also affect the victim trapped within the snake coils, though the GM may allow certain types of attacks to not do so.

**Adder** is the common name for giant poisonous snakes and they come in a variety of species. The poisons are usually negated by a saving throw but some types of adders have a powerful poison which, even if saved against, causes 3d6 points of damage to the victim.

**Cobras** are hooded giant snakes with the ability to spit poison at a single target up to 30-ft distant. The bite of the giant cobra is also quite poisonous. In either case, the victim gets a saving throw to negate the poison.

**Amphisbaena** are 6-ft long snakes with a head at both ends of its body. Both heads are capable of delivering a poisonous bite and victims must save vs poison or die instantly. Its method of travel is as bizarre as the creature's appearance, one head of this unusual snake will grab the neck of the other and the creature then rolls like a hoop upon the ground!

Amphisbaena are carnivorous and like most other reptiles, are cold-blooded and prefer warmer climes. Oddly enough, the amphisbaena is immune to cold based attacks, though the sages are at a loss as to why this is so.

_Treasure:_ None (for all giant snakes).

**Sphinx**

There are four kinds of sphinx. Androsphinxes, criosphinxes and hieracosphinxes are always male, while gynosphinxes are always female.

Gynosphinxes prefer the rare androsphinxes as mates, but matings with any of the male kinds are fertile. The children tend to be gynosphinxes, criosphinxes or hieracosphinxes, irrespective of the sub-species of the father. Only a few rare eggs hatch into androsphinxes.

The androsphinx is a more serious-minded creature than his female counterpart. Like the gynosphinx, the androsphinx is a winged lion with a human torso (male though, as the name implies). Also like their female counterparts, the androsphinx love intellectual pursuits and will often grant access to areas they are set to guard or hoards they are watching (providing doing so does not break a prior agreement or endanger the androsphinx in any way). Androsphinxes may be “hired” (if that is the right word) as guardians for a given treasure, place or thing for a while; they are circumspect in their acceptance of such duties and payment must be made in full or they will unleash their wrath on their would-be employers upon completion of the duties set.

Androsphinx all have the ability to emit a deafening roar that functions as a _**horn of blasting**_.

Less “magical” than their more human-seeming kin, the criosphinx is a winged lion with the head of a ram. These creatures simply collect treasure and hunt much as other intelligent beings. They attack with front claws and can headbutt an opponent. On a successful roll of 20, a head-butted opponent is stunned for a single round.

The storied gynosphinx is a winged half-woman, half lion creature that dwells in arid climes amid abandoned tombs and the like. She is often found near ruins or caves, but occasionally prowls the desert. The chief pursuits of the gynosphinx are intellectual; their kind prefers riddles and puzzles and complex games to (almost) any other type of activity.

Although basically good in nature, the gynosphinx is capricious and will not hesitate to “corner” a creature and dem and some sort of payment for release (usually in the form of a song, story, a game of chess, etc.). Offers of payment in the form of material bribes are always welcome. Flattery can be used against these vain she-beasts as necessary.

Like her kin the gynosphinx is a spell caster; she can use once per day _read magic_, _read languages_, _detect invisibility_, _locate object_, _dispel magic_, _clairvoyance_, _clairaudience_, _remove curse_ or legend lore (this last spell she greatly prefers to use as gynosphinxes can be storehouses of knowledge and pride themselves on the ability).

While admirers of both male and female human and demi-human forms, they loathe the male (crio- and hieraco-) counterparts of their own species, as a rule.

The dreaded hieracosphinx is an eminently evil being. A hawk-headed, winged lion, it prowls desolate places and preys on unsuspecting lone travellers or weak parties of people. Its appetite for warm flesh is nearly insatiable and it is utterly merciless in its pursuit. The creature will often toy with opponents, chasing them for league upon league through the desert under the blazing sun, and when they think they have reached relative safety, the beast will swoop down and attack with its razor sharp beak and talons, rending and slicing flesh like a long sword.

Even the non-good aligned sphinx types hate these beasts and will not normally hesitate to attack them and slay them. Unfortunately they are often hatched, and it is rumoured that they have recently begun to appear in cold climes.

Rather than being hunters, these creatures are like their common, tiny cousins in that they build webs to ensnare prey. In addition to their venomous bite, it takes 2 combat rounds to break free from their webs (+1 additional round for each point of strength below 17). In some fantasy worlds, such as those inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth™, giant spiders can speak Common; in others, they are voiceless.

These are like their giant land-based cousins in most respects. They differ in that they do not build webs per se, rather; they build underwater lairs and carefully transfer air trapped in web-sacs to the lairs. They can hide within and wait for unwary swimmers, whereupon they will scuttle out and drag their prey down, poisoning them, cocooning them, and removing them to their lair to consume.

As their lairs are air-filled, if the creature is slain, these places may be used for one hour for creatures that require air to breathe.

The phase spider is so named because it is able to shift itself subtly in and out of reality during combat. The creature can stay out of phase, waiting to deliver its poisonous bite (victims save at -2; the creature is very deadly). If struck by a _phase door_ spell, the phase spider must remain in phase for eight rounds. Becoming æthereal through magic or other means puts attackers in phase with the creature and they may strike at it with no disadvantage. The webs of this creature are highly sought after for the construction of bags of holding, etc.

Probably originating from a distant place much like the aurumvorax, squealers live in forests. Most are solitary but there is a 10% chance of an encounter with a mated pair and young; the young have 4 HD and do half damage. They are 75% camouflaged in woodlands while they remain still, and prefer to charge by surprise.

A typical squealer is the size and weight of a large gorilla, and has a third arm protruding from its back. It depends from this extra arm and its prehensile feet while attacking with two claws and a bite. If both arm attacks succeed, it will hold its opponent fast and fall upon it from the treelimbs, inflicting an automatic 1d10 hp damage and thereafter attacking with its hind feet as well (increasing to 5 attacks, damage 1d6+6/1d4/1d4/1d4/1d4).

_Treasure:_ Usually none, but some incidental treasure may arise; cf. the listing for aurumvorax for details.

Stirges are bat-like flying mammals. They live in dark places and feed on blood.

A stirge attacks as a 4 hit dice creature. Once it has hit, the stirge has latched on to its victim and will continue draining the victim of 1d3 hp worth of blood per round, without needing any further rolls “to hit”, until the stirge has drunk 10-13 (9+1d4) hp worth of blood, at which time its hunger is satisfied and it will attempt to depart. Only death will prevent the stirge feeding once it has latched on.

_Treasure:_ 1d8×1,000 cp (10%), 1d12×1,000 sp (15%), 1d8×1,000 ep (15%), 1d6×1,000 gp (50%), 2d6 gems (50%), 1d6 jewellery (25%), 1d2 magic items+1 potion (15%).

Stunjellies appear, at a distance, to be no more than a normal section of wall, but should any individual stray too close, they will turn translucent and attack. Most known examples occupy an area 10-ft wide by 10-ft high and 2-ft to 5-ft thick, but larger versions have occasionally been reported.

It is very likely that a Stunjelly will catch its victim by surprise. In addition to the 2d4 damage its mutable tendrils inflict upon a its prey, a saving throw vs paralysis must also be made; failure renders the unfortunate unable to move for 5d4 rounds, which the Stunjelly uses to engulf its victim and begin the process of digestion. Stunjellies are themselves immune to paralysis, as well as polymorph, electrical attacks and mind-influencing spells.

_Treasure:_ Stunjellies carry only what they have consumed.

These giant invertebrates typically dwell in ruins and upper dungeon levels, though some are found in forests as well. They usually seek to ambush their prey, jumping out from hiding. Their initial attack inflicts the damage indicated, and thereafter the giant tick drains 1d6 hp worth of blood automatically. Their bite can cause disease as a giant leech bite does.

Treasure: None.

Titans are powerful creatures not native to the material plane. They normally appear as massive humans, figured and possessed of an unearthly beauty. The movement rate, armour class, and damage caused by titans is as follows:

17 HD: MV 210-ft, AC 2, DAM 7d6  
18 HD: MV 210-ft, AC 1, DAM 7d6  
19 HD: MV 150-ft, AC 0, DAM 7d6  
20 HD: MV 150-ft, AC -1, DAM 7d6  
21 HD: MV 150-ft, AC -2, DAM 8d6  
22 HD: MV 150-ft, AC -3, DAM 8d6  

Titans may levitate at will, and twice per day can either become invisible or shift into the æthereal plane. In addition to these innate abilities, all titans have the ability to cast both clerical and magic spells. For each type of spell, roll 1d4+3. This number represents the maximum spell level the titan can cast for that type of spell. The titan can cast 2 spells of each level.

_Example:_ the die rolls result in a 4 for magic spells and a 6 for clerical spells. The titan would be able to cast 2 first level magic spells, 2 second level, 2 third level and 2 fourth level. He or she would also be able to cast 2 first level clerical spells, 2 second level, 2 third level, 2 fourth level, 2 fifth level, and 2 sixth level.

Titans are immune to all mental attacks, and may have mental powers if the GM makes use of psionics in the campaign. It is possible (20% chance) that a titan will be accompanied by a storm giant, for the two races are friendly with each other.

_Treasure:_ 1d10×1,000 cp (5%), 1d12×1,000 sp (25%), 1d6×1,000 ep (25%), 1d12×1,000 gp (40%), 1d6×1,000 pp (50%), 2d20 gems (50%), 1d8 jewellery (10%), any 3 magic item+1 scroll (25%)

Trappers are underground predators, chameleon-like creatures with flat bodies like a manta ray. They are roughly square in shape, about 20-ft by 20-ft in size (larger and smaller trappers, with proportionally higher or lower hit dice have been encountered), but can alter their dimensions to a considerable degree. These dangerous creatures lie flat on dungeon floors, waiting for prey to step onto them. While waiting in this manner, trappers are viurtually indistinguishable from the surrounding floor, 95% likely to be completely undetectable without the use of magic. When potential prey steps onto the trapper, the monster whips upward to enfold all creatures standing on it. The trapper's stone-hard skin and powerful muscles are deadly. Victims enfolded in the trapper cannot use weapons and will suffocate in 6 rounds. Moreover, before suffocating, victims will suffer 4hp damage per round plus 1 hp per point of armour class. As noted above, trappers take half damage from fire and cold, and no damage at all from such attacks if the monster is entitled to a saving throw and succeeds.

_Treasure:_ 1d4×10,000 gp (50%), 1d20×100 pp (50%), 5d4 gems (30%), 1d10 jewellery (10%), 1 potion, 1 scroll, and 3 other magic items (excluding weapons) (30%)

Tritons resemble humans, but have two fish-like tails instead of legs. These aquatic creatures can live in any depth of water, and are found in the elemental plane of water as well as in the prime material plane. Groups of tritons are composed as follows:

1.  90% chance to be mounted on hippocampi (65%) or giant sea horses (35%)
    

-   Per 10 tritons, 1 leader with 4-6 hit dice (1d3+3)
    
-   Per 10 tritons, 10% chance of 1d4 tritons with magic ability of level 1d6.
    
-   Per 20 tritons, 1 leader with 7-8 hit dice (1d2+6)
    
-   Any number of tritons over 50, 1 leader with 9 hit dice
    
-   A triton leader (9 HD) will carry a shell horn with the following abilities:
    
    -   _Summon allies:_ 5d4 hippocampi, 5d6 giant sea horses, or 1d10 sea lions (depending upon how blown)
        
    -   _Disperse sea animals:_ all sea creatures of animal intelligence must save vs spells at -5 or flee for 3d6 turns
        

Tritons are civilised, dwelling in castles beneath the waves (80% chance) or elaborate caverns of their own excavation (20% chance). These lairs contain additional tritons:

1.  60 normal triton warriors plus leaders as described above
    
2.  1 magic user level 1d2+6
    
3.  1 cleric level 1d4+7
    
4.  4 clerics level 1d4+5

Vilstrak have a rocky hide that allows them to blend well with their subterranean habitat, using an innate ability to merge with the rocks. These monsters are 75% undetectable until closer than 20-ft, at which point they often move to attack with their massive fists.

These creatures tend to lair in hollows of rock and earth. These lairs are difficult to readily access by any being unable to pass through earth and stone, though with some time and effort the opening can be widened enough to allow entry and access to the treasure, gleaned from the vilstrak's victims, stored therein.

Vilstrak appear as a 6-ft tall cross between a human and a bug and has a hide with the consistency of heavy rock. Its forearms are half again longer than that of a human and much more massive, ending in two heavy fists.

_Treasure:_ None carried. Lair: 2d6×1,000 cp(30%), 1d6×1,000 sp (30%), 1d6×1,000 ep(10%), 1d6 gems(30%), 1d3 jewellery (15%), 1 potion or scroll (10%).

Volts are peculiar, magical creatures that attack almost anything that ventures near their lair. They appear as little balls of grey fur with two protruding eyes and a long, whip-like tail that crackles with electricity.

If the creature's bite attack succeeds, it has latched onto its target and will do normal bite damage (1d4 hp) automatically every round. At the same time it will lash its foe with its tail. The tail attack inflicts a strong electric shock (2d6 hp damage). Only victims not wearing metal armour receive a saving throw against this damage, and any victim wearing metal armour is treated as unarmoured (AC 10) for the purposes of the volt's attack.

Volt lairs usually smell slightly of ozone.

Vulchlings are a race of birds that resemble vultures but with features that look rather like a human with a beak. Vulchlings are weak fliers, tending to swoop upon their prey with a claw attack, then fighting on the ground with a bite/bite routine.

Vulchlings can be found in desolate areas or underground, and they have been known to ally themselves with harpies or Class A demons. Vulchlings are attracted to shiny objects and a careful search of their nest usually yields a few coins.

Giant wasps have a poisonous stinger that delivers a paralysing venom. Any creature hit by the stinger must make a saving throw vs poison or become paralysed for 1d4+1 days, followed by death. The wasps generally carry paralysed victims to their nests, where the victims are kept to be eaten by larvae when eggs hatch. Giant wasp nests may be mud-daubed or paper, depending on the type of wasp. Giant wasp wings are instantly burned away if they suffer a successful hit with a flaming object; burning away the wings in this manner does not cause hit point damage to the wasp, but prevents the creature from flying.

Although giant wasps are aerial agility level V, they can hover.

Will-o-the-wisps are strange, fey creatures that resemble dancing lights or torches. Living in desolate and dangerous locations, they seek to draw unwary travellers into bogs or quicksand. Will-o-the-wisps are immune to all spells with the exception of _protection from evil_, _magic missile_, and _maze_. If a will-o-the-wisp is clearly faced with death in combat, it will bargain the location of its treasure in exchange for freedom. The range of a will-o-the-wisp's electric shock attack is 10-ft.

The winter wolf is a large, intelligent, and bad-tempered predator which is found only in the cold wastes. Its coat is typically silver or ivory in colour, and its eyes are ice blue.

In addition to its bite, once every 10 rounds the wolf can breathe cold on any creature within 10-ft of its mouth. This icy breath causes 6d4 points of damage to the victim (or half if he makes a save vs. breath weapon).

The wolf is immune to cold attacks, but vulnerable to fire attacks for which it receives an extra point of damage on each die rolled.

Winter wolves speak their own language, and are also able to talk to worgs.

Their coats are worth 5,000 gold pieces at market.

Wyverns are distant cousins of dragons, extremely vora- cious but dull of intellect. They do not have front legs, and cannot attack effectively with their hind legs. In combat, wyverns rely on their bite and deadly poison stinger. If a character is hit with the wyvern's sting, in addition to the normal damage he must save vs poison or fall dead.

Xorn are bizarre creatures from the elemental planes of earth that eat precious metals and other minerals. They have a rock-like consistency, granting an extremely good armour class, and appear to be made of stone. Xorn have a barrel-shaped body, radially symmetrical with three eyes, three arms, three stubby legs, and a powerful mouth set in the top of the creature's body. The stone-like appearance grants the xorn a tremendously good chance of surprising its enemies.

Xorn are immune to fire and cold damage, and take only half damage from electrical attacks (no damage when saving throws are successful). A xorn can swim through stone, but requires a full melee round to enter solid rock, during which time it cannot attack. A _phase door_ spell will utterly destroy a xorn that is travelling through rock or readjusting its composition.

Xorn are particularly vulnerable to spells that affect earth and stone. _Move earth_ spells may be used to hurl a xorn backwards 30-ft and stun them for a full round. _Stone to flesh_ and _rock to mud_ spells weaken the xorn's elemental structure, increasing the creature's AC to 8 until the xorn concentrates for a full round to readjust its composition. _Passwall_ spells inflict 1d10+10 points of damage with no saving throw.

_Treasure:_ 1d4×1,000 cp (25%), 1d8×1,000 sp (30%), 1d2×1,000 ep (25%), 2d6×1,000 gp (70%), 5d4 gems (50%), 1 misc. magic+1 potion (60%)

Yeti are tall and vaguely ape-like humanoids completely covered in thick white hair and weighing in at 300 lbs. Yeti have ivory clawed and quite large feet and hands, a mouthful of sharp fangs, and are known to crave the taste of human flesh. Yeti inhabit regions of ice and snow, generally in the cold regions of the world, but sometimes in area with mountains high enough to stay snow-capped the year round. In spite of their appearance yeti are not albinos, they have eyes of pale blue or a very light, almost white, grey.

In combat the yeti attacks with its clawed hands and if it strikes with a roll of a natural 20 it has grabbed its opponent and squeezed him or her in its powerful arms, inflicting another 2d8 points of damage (cold-resistant creatures take only 1d8 points of damage from this attack).

If surprised by a yeti, an adventurer must roll a saving throw vs paralysis. Failing the save means he or she has inadvertently looked into the creature's eyes and has been struck with intense fright and unable to move or react for 3 melee rounds. During this time, the unfortunate victim will be both struck twice and suffer the squeezing attack of the yeti twice.

Because of their extreme adaptation to living in cold climates, yeti suffer 50% greater damage from heat and fire based attacks. Because of their colouration and habitat, yeti are virtually invisible until within 20-ft of their prey, though higher-level characters have a 10% chance per level of spotting one at normal viewing ranges. Though yeti have no real use for treasure, they do realize its worth to other beings and, as such, a random collection of coins and valuables can be found in their lairs.

Yeti lairs usually comprise a pod of 1 male, 1d4 females, and 1d4+1 younglings. If younglings are present, the females will fight to the death to protect them, requiring no morale check.

_Treasure:_ None carried. In lair: 1d6×1,000 cp (10%), 1d10×1,000 sp (35%), 1d6×1,000 ep (15%), 1d6×1,000 gp (65%), 1d10 gems (35%), 2d4 jewellery (30%), 2 random magic items+2 potions (10%).
