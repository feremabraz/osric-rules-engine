# Magic Item Identification

Summary: Process for determining properties of discovered magic items.

Inputs:
- Item type (weapon, armor, potion, scroll, ring, wand, miscellaneous)
- Identification method (detect magic, experimentation, identify spell)
- Caster level (for identify spell)

Outputs:
- Identified properties (name, bonus, charges, command word, curses)
- Unidentified aspects flagged

Tables / Values:
- Identify spell success: automatic core properties; 1% cumulative failure chance per property beyond first (placeholder; confirm OSRIC).
- Experimentation risk: % chance triggering curse (varies by item category: e.g., 10%).

Procedure:
1. If Identify spell cast: reveal base enhancement, charges (approximate if wand), required command word (maybe partial), note aura school.
2. If detect magic only: mark item as magical (no specifics).
3. Experimentation: attempt use; on success glean one property; on curse roll may activate curse.
4. Repeat sessions until fully identified or abandoned.

Edge Cases:
- Cursed item disguises as beneficial; Identify may require multiple castings.
- Potions identified by sip test (with small effect risk) vs full identify.

Future Extensions:
- Lore skill checks granting partial reveals.
