# Spell Research

Summary: Process for creating new or variant spells through time, cost, and success chance.

Inputs:
- Spell concept definition (level target, school, effect parameters)
- Caster level, INT/WIS
- Laboratory/resources quality
- Time allocation per research phase

Outputs:
- Research phase progress %
- Success/failure for phase
- Total time and gold spent
- Final learnable spell (on completion)

Tables / Values:
- Base research time: Weeks = Spell Level * factor (e.g., 2 weeks) baseline.
- Base cost: 1000 gp * Spell Level (placeholder; confirm OSRIC).
- Success check: % = Base + (Caster Level + INT modifier) * small factor; failure may extend time/cost.

Procedure:
1. Define target spell parameters (enforce level feasibility vs effect potency guidelines).
2. For each research period (week): deduct gold upkeep, accumulate time.
3. At milestone (end of base time), roll success check.
4. If success: produce draft spell requiring Spell Learning roll (with bonus) to finalize.
5. If failure: add additional time/cost (e.g., +25%) and repeat milestone.

Edge Cases:
- Insufficient funds mid-phase: pause progress (no decay).
- Disruption (adventure): lost week; resume later.

Future Extensions:
- Collaborative research reducing time.
