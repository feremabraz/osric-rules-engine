# Scroll Creation

Summary: Process for scribing a spell scroll including requirements, time, cost, and mishap chances.

Inputs:
- Spell to scribe (must be known and prepared)
- Caster level & class
- Scribing environment quality
- Materials on hand (ink, parchment, rare components)

Outputs:
- Scroll item (spell stored, charges 1)
- Time taken
- Cost consumed
- Mishap (if any)

Tables / Values:
- Base time: 1 day per spell level (minimum 1 day).
- Base cost: 100 gp per spell level (placeholder; confirm OSRIC) + material rarity surcharges.
- Mishap chance: 1% per spell level if rushed (reduced time); normal 0% baseline.

Procedure:
1. Verify spell qualifies (correct class list, caster able to cast level).
2. Ensure materials; deduct cost upfront.
3. Spend required days (tracking interruptions).
4. If rushed (reduced days), compute mishap chance and roll; on mishap roll result on mishap table (spell reversed, scroll wasted, explosion minimal damage, etc.).
5. On success produce scroll with encoded spell; mark slot expended for day.

Edge Cases:
- Interruption mid-day: day does not count; resume.
- Duplicate scrolls allowed limited by resources.

Future Extensions:
- Multi-spell scroll sequences.
