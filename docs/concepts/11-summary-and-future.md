# 11. Summary & Future Directions

This concludes the concept series:
1. Overview
2. Configuration & Startup
3. Entities & IDs
4. Store & Mutation Model
5. Commands & Rules
6. Execution Lifecycle
7. Error & Result Model
8. RNG & Determinism
9. Effects & Events
10. Testing Utilities

## Current Guarantees
- Deterministic rule ordering & failure modes
- Strong input/output validation via Zod
- Clear separation of structural vs domain failures
- Immutable entity drafts & stored records

## Near-Term Enhancements (Potential)
- Rich effect dispatch / subscription model
- Additional entity catalogs (spells, equipment specifics)
- Feature flags gating optional subsystems (morale, weather)
- Composite command composition / batching
- Persisted world state adapter
- Perâ€‘rule timing metrics & structured logs

Refer to `docs/authoring` for how to extend the system with new commands and rules, and `docs/usage` for consumer-facing integration patterns.
