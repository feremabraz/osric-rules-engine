# 1. Authoring Overview

This track assumes you know all core concepts (see `../concepts`). It focuses on how to extend the engine codebase or your local project with new commands, rules, entities, and tests.

## Authoring Goals
- Minimal boilerplate (structural rule classes)
- Fail fast at startup (dependency & schema validation)
- Deterministic results & effect isolation

Subsequent chapters dive into command structure, rule design, error semantics, and testing patterns.

Next: Command File Template (2).
